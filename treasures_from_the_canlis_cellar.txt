00:03:01 i'm doing an introduction this is nelson
00:03:03 to kip you've already seen him he's kind
00:03:05 of a big deal here at campus community
00:03:06 college i'm so excited to be
00:03:08 learning from you tonight you're a wine
00:03:10 director you've been here for
00:03:13 18 years 18 years um you started at the
00:03:16 bottom
00:03:17 you worked your way to the top you're
00:03:19 more than a wine director i want to brag
00:03:20 about you for a little bit because i
00:03:21 feel like you're a lot of classes in
00:03:23 and no one has said this because i
00:03:24 haven't done this with you you're not
00:03:26 just a wine director
00:03:27 you are the cultural leader of our
00:03:29 company
00:03:30 you're a mentor and a trainee to so many
00:03:32 of my staff
00:03:34 you're a fl a champion and a standard
00:03:36 bearer of who we are
00:03:38 in this company of our values and of
00:03:41 everything we stand for from
00:03:42 professionalism to personally
00:03:44 personal uh personally i just respect
00:03:47 the hell out of you and
00:03:48 uh i just want to say how excited i am
00:03:49 to be with you today so that's who
00:03:51 you're with
00:03:52 he also knows a little thing or two
00:03:53 about wine so
00:03:55 um yeah talk about okay so this was
00:03:58 i feel like this was kind of your idea
00:04:00 talk about a little bit the genesis of
00:04:01 where this
00:04:02 yeah i don't know if it was my idea or
00:04:04 not but when we talked about like
00:04:06 what it looks like to have what classes
00:04:08 make sense
00:04:09 um you know we did box wine we did wine
00:04:12 drinking 101
00:04:13 cocktails 101 so we're kind of working
00:04:15 through fundamentals of what it looks
00:04:17 like
00:04:18 to be drinking at home and being cool
00:04:20 with it or
00:04:21 starting starting it was a community
00:04:24 college right so we were like okay
00:04:25 come on we can't in fact i think
00:04:28 originally we had like this normal wine
00:04:30 classroom like let's go through
00:04:31 chardonnay and pinot noir right and it
00:04:33 felt weird we're like that's not what
00:04:34 you do in a pandemic it's not what you
00:04:36 do for community college
00:04:38 that's like 201 and we were like how do
00:04:40 we strip it down
00:04:41 to 101 yeah and that was way it was way
00:04:43 more fun it takes the pressure off of
00:04:46 um what we would even be doing to teach
00:04:48 our staff what the fundamentals are and
00:04:50 then start to like dig into detail and
00:04:52 information
00:04:52 and it's hard to if you don't follow up
00:04:54 with that or reinforce it
00:04:56 yeah by serving wine or by having to
00:04:59 actively
00:05:00 continue to taste wine then you're
00:05:02 almost a little behind
00:05:04 on it so you don't you don't have that
00:05:06 that affirmation of information
00:05:08 then connect it with sort of like what's
00:05:10 what's confirming it on the palette so
00:05:12 and maybe for those that weren't able to
00:05:14 join us for the other ones
00:05:15 um you have recently been um pairing
00:05:18 boxed wine
00:05:18 to gummy bears covered in leahey mui
00:05:21 powder
00:05:22 uh and to doritos and to other things um
00:05:25 we've been we've been sort of starting
00:05:26 from the ground up but tonight
00:05:28 uh we wanted to dig into the cellar a
00:05:30 little bit and we wanted to see
00:05:32 uh what it was like to to kind of um get
00:05:35 back into
00:05:36 some of the bottles that we dream of
00:05:38 serving we don't we don't serve these
00:05:40 all the time that's for certain
00:05:41 um these are rare bottles for us even to
00:05:44 pull out and the ones that really make
00:05:45 us excited when you're at the table and
00:05:47 you're like all right
00:05:48 i'm going big let's do this tonight and
00:05:51 these they kind of get us giddy
00:05:52 but we come down here we run down the
00:05:54 stairs it rings in and the wine station
00:05:56 upstairs
00:05:57 and uh we we run down here and we go
00:06:00 this is what i do i go searching through
00:06:02 nelson actually knows exactly where all
00:06:03 the bottles are
00:06:04 there are three sellers here at canlis
00:06:06 we're in the main cellar
00:06:08 um and i don't know these are wines we
00:06:10 get excited about
00:06:11 you did a dinner like this when did we
00:06:14 do that 10 years ago
00:06:15 it feels like longer than yeah yeah 12
00:06:17 14 years ago
00:06:18 and it was called like like what was it
00:06:20 what did we do like the perfect night or
00:06:22 like 100 point
00:06:23 wine dinner 100 point dinner or
00:06:24 something yeah i don't know who was
00:06:26 scoring the hundred points was that
00:06:28 did we make that up no i think it was i
00:06:30 think it was probably usually
00:06:31 one wine that we sort of like said this
00:06:34 is our hundred point wine because
00:06:36 we just was like our own private label
00:06:38 champagne and we needed this we
00:06:40 deserve the right to give it yes
00:06:41 whatever it was uh
00:06:43 mark candles rated hundred point wine so
00:06:45 i mean like take it with a grain of salt
00:06:47 what people are doing
00:06:50 this is a countless hundred porter yeah
00:06:53 and there carries more weight actually
00:06:55 but that was a dinner that allowed us
00:06:58 the opportunity
00:06:59 to dig into again another deep seller um
00:07:02 what did we do i think we did like 30
00:07:03 people or so
00:07:04 upstairs in the past back in days where
00:07:06 you know all the strangers got together
00:07:08 on one table one big table we did we did
00:07:10 a big kings table yeah
00:07:12 and we wanted it to feel i think this i
00:07:14 mean i'm just gonna get into it right
00:07:15 now like i think when you're going
00:07:16 when you're opening a special bottle and
00:07:18 that has nothing to do with the price
00:07:19 tag when you're opening a special bottle
00:07:21 there is something about everyone
00:07:24 together
00:07:24 around that one table and even though it
00:07:26 was a private event
00:07:27 in a big room with a bunch of strangers
00:07:30 we stuck them all
00:07:31 30 of them i think it was actually 32
00:07:33 maybe but if i'm but like
00:07:34 all at one big table we said tonight
00:07:36 we're family tonight we're we're kind of
00:07:38 do going through this together and i
00:07:40 i feel so much like that is the heart of
00:07:42 what the wine program is about anyway
00:07:44 yeah
00:07:45 and here we are again
00:07:48 i should mention to join we're joined
00:07:51 tonight by my brother
00:07:53 uh brian who's gonna be picking up the
00:07:55 chat brian welcome it's good to have you
00:07:57 here tonight
00:07:58 you guys didn't wait for me well no we
00:07:59 just decided to get it rolling
00:08:01 first 7 p.m shark well here's the thing
00:08:03 we're not used to doing community
00:08:04 college on a friday we pushed it back to
00:08:06 the election
00:08:07 so this is all a little different for us
00:08:10 brian had his had his and it was it was
00:08:13 it was that and it was also saying that
00:08:15 this night is gonna be a special night
00:08:17 friday night date night
00:08:19 you're at home like let's go through and
00:08:22 let's make it special
00:08:23 let's go through like like exceptional
00:08:25 bottles of wine
00:08:26 let's learn a little let's enjoy the
00:08:28 wines let's
00:08:29 have some cheese we've got some folks at
00:08:31 home that were able to get the kit
00:08:33 we are so sorry for everyone was on the
00:08:35 wait list um
00:08:36 we were not able to get as much of the
00:08:38 fancy wine as we could
00:08:40 particularly the mouton was a little
00:08:41 hard to get our hands on we grabbed as
00:08:42 many bottles as we could
00:08:44 so some of the people at home who have
00:08:46 the kit what should they be doing right
00:08:48 now
00:08:48 are we like you should have pulled out
00:08:50 all of your wines if you haven't already
00:08:51 pull out all of your wines from
00:08:54 from the refrigerator you store them
00:08:55 there overnight we want the whites to be
00:08:57 chilled and we want the reds to start to
00:08:59 warm up to room temperature
00:09:01 but still have a little bit of that
00:09:03 freshness to it that zip on the pallet
00:09:05 so the moment it hits it's just got that
00:09:07 light um
00:09:08 sort of like sensation of it being cold
00:09:10 but really what it's going to do is just
00:09:12 like
00:09:12 warm up open up okay so tell us about
00:09:14 the temperature just for a second
00:09:15 because we're in the cellar
00:09:16 we keep it at 50 58 degrees am i doing
00:09:19 that right okay
00:09:20 why because you have whites down here
00:09:21 like i'm looking at all of our white
00:09:23 burgundies are down here we serve them
00:09:25 at 58 degrees
00:09:27 um unless guests want them colder
00:09:30 and a lot of times these may benefit
00:09:32 younger white wines
00:09:33 especially ones from burgundy will
00:09:36 benefit from being served just a little
00:09:38 cooler so we'll throw it on ice for
00:09:39 about five minutes or so if not
00:09:41 serve it in a bucket brought to the
00:09:42 table but you want to see it go through
00:09:44 the range of temperatures from being
00:09:46 cold or cool
00:09:47 then something to warm up as you're
00:09:49 eating your meal so talk about
00:09:50 right like when it's really cold it has
00:09:52 this like um this refreshing
00:09:54 characteristic right almost a more of a
00:09:57 a thirst quenching thing
00:09:58 going on but then as those wines are
00:10:00 warming
00:10:01 we're starting to get different flavors
00:10:03 different smells different different
00:10:04 things
00:10:05 for sure yeah and on the palette just
00:10:08 gives tannin
00:10:09 when you move into red wine that
00:10:10 opportunities to sort of like
00:10:12 open up a lot easier on the palette fine
00:10:14 for for fat
00:10:15 that's what tannins looking for to
00:10:17 attach itself to
00:10:18 um chemically tannin actually grabs fat
00:10:21 like that's
00:10:22 right yeah because we always talk about
00:10:24 acid and fat being balanced in a
00:10:26 in a pairing but the tannin actually is
00:10:28 also
00:10:30 going for actively looking for something
00:10:32 fatty on their palette so that comes
00:10:34 from
00:10:34 cheese that comes from meat once you
00:10:36 start to like yeah
00:10:38 like go through it and through your
00:10:39 dinner uh so that
00:10:41 is what tannin will grab onto and if you
00:10:44 don't have anything on your palette
00:10:46 if you're doing a long tasting or
00:10:47 drinking a lot of red wines you'll find
00:10:49 that the film sort of like
00:10:50 add up onto your tongue yeah you'll like
00:10:53 see these little strands you're like
00:10:54 what is this it's like
00:10:55 that's actually tannin attacking any bit
00:10:58 of
00:10:58 richness of looking for fat to attach
00:11:00 itself to yeah so that when you drink
00:11:02 um the rest of the wine all you get is
00:11:04 that sort of like clean part of what
00:11:05 wine can do
00:11:07 or what flavors come with so guys
00:11:08 tonight uh we're taking a notch up
00:11:10 uh maybe it's this is 201 or something
00:11:12 but um we're gonna go
00:11:14 into like i'm gonna be asking nelson to
00:11:16 count like i don't know i think of you
00:11:18 as a ferrari and we've been driving you
00:11:19 at like a sweet 25 miles an hour and
00:11:22 tonight
00:11:22 i'm here to like push the pedal down and
00:11:24 like get into it and we're going to geek
00:11:26 out a little bit and if you have
00:11:27 questions about that
00:11:28 um throw them in the chat if we go too
00:11:30 fast or too far or something or which
00:11:32 it's like what are you talking about
00:11:33 um send a question our way uh but we
00:11:36 kind of want to get into
00:11:38 some of the funness of really like
00:11:40 in-depth food and wine pairing right and
00:11:42 so
00:11:42 and i was just gonna say about the
00:11:44 cheese pull that out also we want that
00:11:46 actually to temp
00:11:46 we want that to come up to temp like to
00:11:48 warm up a little bit and temper so
00:11:50 um yank that out of the refrigerator
00:11:51 also if you haven't already
00:11:53 yeah where do we start let's start with
00:11:55 white wine okay
00:11:56 so this is sold um out of marisol
00:12:01 when you say marisol you're talking
00:12:03 about a region in burgundy yeah
00:12:05 so this is in burgundy and when we say
00:12:07 burgundy we're talking about france
00:12:08 they're talking about france okay cool
00:12:10 and we're talking about chardonnay or
00:12:11 pinot noir
00:12:13 so pinot noir when we talk about white
00:12:16 burgundy
00:12:17 aren't we with like 98 and a half
00:12:19 percent always talking about chardonnay
00:12:22 is that is that fair is that a fair
00:12:23 assessment i would say random you would
00:12:25 assume that that is chardonnay okay
00:12:26 assume that the grape is chardonnay
00:12:28 the region is burgundy and specifically
00:12:30 when we talk about marseille
00:12:32 that's a region in burgundy a
00:12:33 neighborhood how do you describe a
00:12:35 village
00:12:35 a village a village in burgundy that's
00:12:38 that would be the official term for it
00:12:40 and oh captain okay kevin we don't need
00:12:43 that we're gonna finish that one we're
00:12:44 gonna go
00:12:44 fishing i don't even know where i'm at
00:12:46 and we're back and this is done by
00:12:48 dominique lafon
00:12:49 so this is domain com de la fun um this
00:12:52 you'll as you sort of like read through
00:12:54 the label in itself
00:12:55 this is clodella baron out of marseille
00:12:58 so it's taking you down
00:12:59 even smaller to a vineyard there that's
00:13:01 been that was produced first in 2012
00:13:04 and this is all chardonnay france love
00:13:06 to do this like like they don't put
00:13:07 france on the top but they almost said
00:13:09 they
00:13:09 should say france on the label because
00:13:11 then you get the region
00:13:13 they don't really say burgundy
00:13:14 necessarily but then you get more so and
00:13:16 then we're going to come down into like
00:13:17 smaller pieces of the village
00:13:19 right often in a good wine all the way
00:13:21 down to the vineyard
00:13:22 correct is that right okay so then when
00:13:24 you walk through that label
00:13:26 clueless cool okay uh and you kind of
00:13:29 dropped a big name there so when we say
00:13:31 complete fall
00:13:32 you just talk about that for a second
00:13:34 yes why why does why does that send
00:13:36 happy shivers down
00:13:37 this is this is dominique lafon and he
00:13:39 is i would say leading the charge as far
00:13:41 as
00:13:41 um winemakers out of france really
00:13:44 trying to convert their vineyards from
00:13:45 being
00:13:47 just what was like you know um vineyards
00:13:49 that were cultivated to make to for for
00:13:51 wine production
00:13:52 into being more sustainable and
00:13:54 resourceful in the vineyards so what
00:13:55 they're doing
00:13:56 what he's doing with a lot of other like
00:13:58 um
00:13:59 like forward-thinking wine makers and
00:14:02 vineyards that they're going to the
00:14:03 vineyard converting them to either being
00:14:05 organic
00:14:05 and biodynamic and we talked about that
00:14:08 yesterday again with what it looks like
00:14:10 to being someone that owns a vineyard
00:14:12 having control of it from beginning to
00:14:13 end
00:14:14 and making decisions today for what it
00:14:16 looks like to have
00:14:17 great wines in the future yeah so this
00:14:19 is an estate now fourth j
00:14:21 fourth generation um where you do you
00:14:24 fourth generation the fall oh yeah
00:14:26 that's our gym over here
00:14:27 yeah and i would say that you know like
00:14:28 uh
00:14:30 yeah this people want to see the label
00:14:32 you want this one you want this one yeah
00:14:33 let's get it here
00:14:34 all the way up here okay cool yeah this
00:14:36 is a label we're just going to put this
00:14:37 right here
00:14:38 so you guys can zoom in on it how's that
00:14:40 also
00:14:41 while we're interrupting over here
00:14:42 what's our what's our like list price
00:14:44 what what what's this bottle this is
00:14:46 350. i think 350 for a bottle 350 on the
00:14:49 list yeah
00:14:50 3.50 cents 300.
00:14:52 [Laughter]
00:14:54 that's most important yeah but you know
00:14:57 i i look
00:14:58 to him for white wine more than i do
00:15:00 reds and i would say that with
00:15:02 with chardonnay there are really of some
00:15:05 really great producers that we're
00:15:06 looking towards
00:15:07 um and dominique lafon would definitely
00:15:09 be one that i look at and saying i love
00:15:11 his white wines
00:15:13 his um his home the winery itself is in
00:15:16 marseille
00:15:17 if you drive through and start going
00:15:19 through the village you'll see
00:15:21 that his estate is surrounded by
00:15:23 vineyards so it's someone
00:15:25 who's intimately um attached
00:15:28 and or known for what's happening in the
00:15:30 vineyards on a daily basis
00:15:32 and somebody that's connected to kind of
00:15:34 what burgundy is famous for right so
00:15:37 all of europe just about every corner of
00:15:39 europe is growing wine um but
00:15:40 specifically in burgundy
00:15:42 you have these people who are farmer
00:15:45 grower winemaker like this is their life
00:15:48 it's not as if they're up in paris
00:15:50 they own a chateau somewhere down south
00:15:52 and they're just sort of dialing it in
00:15:53 these people are walking the
00:15:55 walking the vineyards all the time right
00:15:56 they're the ones like literally like
00:15:58 growing grapes making wine it's sort of
00:16:00 that romantic thing that we dream of
00:16:02 this is where this is happening and
00:16:04 probably maybe
00:16:05 maybe more than any other region in
00:16:07 france is that other any other major
00:16:09 region in france because bordeaux kind
00:16:10 of you have this thing and champagne you
00:16:12 got this thing but like in burgundy i
00:16:13 would say yeah i would say burgundy and
00:16:15 probably a lot of places in the loire
00:16:16 valley
00:16:17 okay yeah okay just the farmers just
00:16:20 maybe the idea of what it would feel
00:16:22 like to be
00:16:23 a great brewer farmer and then call that
00:16:26 a good living
00:16:27 right honest hard-working wholesome
00:16:29 wines
00:16:31 nurturing caring for the vineyards for
00:16:33 today and then and then in the future
00:16:35 and then ushering the next generation
00:16:36 that's the responsibility of burgundy
00:16:38 and that's something that i think
00:16:40 has maybe one of the longest histories
00:16:43 of
00:16:43 having vineyards planted going back to
00:16:46 the cistercian monks
00:16:47 i'm going to call this good living i
00:16:49 just stuck my nose in it about eight
00:16:50 times
00:16:51 yeah let's do it can you take us through
00:16:53 it can you just sort of like um
00:16:54 yeah what are we smelling here what are
00:16:56 you looking for when i when i
00:16:58 um once i start to swirl the glass
00:17:01 and i put my nose in i immediately get
00:17:04 like this
00:17:04 note of um sort of like this
00:17:08 golden apple right so you're looking for
00:17:11 fruit
00:17:12 yeah i thought i picked up some oak
00:17:14 partly because we're starting a bonfire
00:17:16 outside for the drum circle and we used
00:17:19 oak trimming for the but like
00:17:20 yeah i don't know i get oak too you do
00:17:22 you do i get that vanilla i get that
00:17:24 vanilla note to it it always makes me
00:17:26 get a little
00:17:26 toasty sort of quality a little sad when
00:17:28 that's the first thing i grab but i'm
00:17:30 just
00:17:30 a little less trained nose which is mine
00:17:32 compared to his
00:17:34 um i think sometimes that's the first
00:17:35 thing we grab is maybe you run into that
00:17:37 vanilla thing or something
00:17:38 but then underneath that you're talking
00:17:40 about that like the fruit component and
00:17:43 and i see what you're saying like golden
00:17:45 apple like crushed golden apple or
00:17:46 something right with a little bit of
00:17:48 i get that i get more of um more like a
00:17:50 honey note to it okay
00:17:52 and beyond that i get tons of floral
00:17:54 qualities
00:17:56 and then i get citrus i get sort of like
00:17:58 this meyer lemon and i get a little bit
00:18:00 more of that sort of like
00:18:01 candy uh that's not a candied lime but
00:18:04 so is it always safe smelling a lime
00:18:07 because i'll just be honest i'm an
00:18:08 impatient
00:18:09 wine sniffer but the pros
00:18:13 talk about why it's so important you
00:18:15 guys are really coming through
00:18:17 making some some um assessments of the
00:18:20 wine
00:18:21 first with your nose unadulterated
00:18:24 unbiased with the palette right right
00:18:26 and then you're gonna confirm or deny
00:18:28 that it's almost like a a first pass
00:18:30 review and then a second pass review
00:18:32 and is that what you're doing with your
00:18:33 palette you're actually just kind of
00:18:34 going back and saying this is what my
00:18:35 nose found
00:18:37 you made your nose do the work right and
00:18:39 then your palate is like confirming or
00:18:41 denying is that
00:18:42 exactly exactly you know i i would say
00:18:43 that information you get
00:18:46 based on on the aromatics on the of wine
00:18:48 on its nose
00:18:50 will tell you a lot more throughout the
00:18:52 night than
00:18:53 tasting it will right so that
00:18:55 confirmation that you're looking for on
00:18:56 the palette
00:18:57 really is only available to what you
00:18:59 have left in the glass so when
00:19:01 when guests are dining in and they share
00:19:03 an ounce of wine with us
00:19:05 it's something that we do as homework
00:19:06 right so the generosity that we guess
00:19:08 based off of what we're doing for them
00:19:10 allows us to stay
00:19:12 on top of our game it allows us to sort
00:19:14 of like reconnect with the wine
00:19:15 gives us an idea of where the vintage is
00:19:16 at um confirming what the producer is
00:19:18 doing
00:19:19 but one ounce of wine may be only maybe
00:19:23 one or two sips
00:19:24 that we can share with the team so
00:19:25 sometimes people will send a glass back
00:19:27 and they'll be like what'd you guys
00:19:28 think and i'm like oh no it's still back
00:19:29 there
00:19:30 and there are four of them and they've
00:19:31 been smelling it for 30 minutes like
00:19:33 it you're we're learning a lot right and
00:19:36 and it's an important stage not just as
00:19:38 an individual taster if you guys at home
00:19:40 but uh not only is that what i'm trying
00:19:42 to say is educationally
00:19:44 man we gobble that stuff up with our
00:19:45 noses because if nelson takes a sip no
00:19:47 one else gets to experience it
00:19:49 um right but it's an important um
00:19:52 obviously a really important
00:19:53 we're also looking for the soundness of
00:19:54 the wine and the ones that we've sent
00:19:56 all to y'all you guys yeah knows those
00:19:58 before we put them in bottles instead
00:20:00 you know what i'm liking
00:20:01 what a part of what's choosing and
00:20:04 selecting these wines are
00:20:05 making sure that they're drinking well
00:20:06 today this is a relatively young part
00:20:09 a youthful burgundy vintage um
00:20:12 released a few years ago but something
00:20:14 that's drinking well so where are we at
00:20:15 we're 2015 2015. you know i don't like
00:20:18 based on what i've been going through in
00:20:20 the last you know like
00:20:21 15 years of real deep study into wine
00:20:25 um i always thought that white wines
00:20:28 couldn't age yeah right you go into that
00:20:30 and right when i started off i was like
00:20:33 yeah that's not true i was we were
00:20:35 drinking great white wines from burgundy
00:20:37 um early 90s um
00:20:40 even late 80s and then all of a sudden
00:20:43 there was a point
00:20:45 you know like a decade ago where things
00:20:46 started to change right so this sort of
00:20:48 like idea of oxygen
00:20:50 um primox and
00:20:53 uh is what people are calling so like
00:20:55 the premature oxidation of wines
00:20:58 um started to creep into and not absorb
00:21:00 and started to creep into
00:21:02 wine making as a practice burgundy
00:21:05 instead of as a mistake right so right
00:21:06 so all so what's happening with wine
00:21:08 here if you back up one step so
00:21:10 we're making fruit and if you think a
00:21:12 banana or an apple on your counter it's
00:21:14 turning brown that's oxidization right
00:21:15 right and and
00:21:16 some things protect wines from that
00:21:19 namely
00:21:19 tannin yeah uh so which is why people
00:21:22 think oh red wines can go the distance
00:21:24 yeah but also does an acidity protection
00:21:26 if i take a lemon juice and squeeze it
00:21:28 over my
00:21:29 my bananas it doesn't turn brown right
00:21:30 and is that what you're saying here it's
00:21:32 a good white wine with bracing acidity
00:21:34 yeah and the structure how how long
00:21:36 could this you know
00:21:37 even even beyond that maybe those are
00:21:38 small things that we kind of
00:21:40 no one understand that can preserve
00:21:42 wines but
00:21:44 in the process in itself a lot of times
00:21:46 it can be
00:21:47 can be without not using enough sulfur
00:21:50 in the bottling of wines
00:21:52 it's so it's it's um oxidizing in itself
00:21:56 it can be a problem stirring the leaves
00:21:58 into chardonnay in wilds in barrel
00:22:00 that can prematurely oxidize the wines
00:22:02 by introducing too much
00:22:04 oxygen which captured in the wine itself
00:22:07 and then slowly deteriorate so those are
00:22:09 all things that
00:22:10 that have been slightly corrected over
00:22:12 the years
00:22:13 but um i've then found myself drinking a
00:22:16 lot more youthful white ones than i do
00:22:19 than i did when i first started so maybe
00:22:21 maybe an idea of like
00:22:22 can this wine age it's made to last it's
00:22:24 built to age
00:22:26 a higher level of acidity normal you
00:22:29 know as opposed to what white wines from
00:22:30 california would look like
00:22:32 an amount of oak that's meant to both
00:22:35 uh contribute to flavor uh and texture
00:22:38 to the wine
00:22:39 which is helpful but when it's young
00:22:41 it's just like a little overpowering
00:22:43 that oak is getting its structure
00:22:44 correct it's giving it a little
00:22:46 it's giving it some legs some distance
00:22:47 and it's going to give it yeah it's
00:22:48 going to it's going to
00:22:49 help it age gracefully down the road
00:22:53 but in this case i wouldn't wait too
00:22:54 long
00:22:57 hey it's in its prime right now yeah i
00:22:58 would i would give it a ten year window
00:23:00 i like drinking it youthful for uh i
00:23:02 like drinking it vibrant
00:23:04 because what you're saying is if we wait
00:23:05 too long the auction
00:23:07 has its effect on the fruit and the
00:23:09 fruit starts to fall out and some of the
00:23:11 other
00:23:12 um notes come forward and so you're
00:23:14 saying and a wine
00:23:16 of this power and magnitude you want to
00:23:18 get that fruit like you'd be sad
00:23:19 it's not that it wouldn't taste good in
00:23:21 20 years but you've you've lost sort of
00:23:23 that
00:23:23 so that bright crisp fruity note that we
00:23:26 that we like is that
00:23:27 what you're saying okay okay cool so
00:23:29 this one's an oh it's a 15. you drink it
00:23:31 in five years but you
00:23:32 you're kind of saying are you like
00:23:34 drinking it now okay it'll last a few
00:23:36 more years put it in the cellar i think
00:23:38 don't be afraid of drinking some of the
00:23:39 white wines the little youth
00:23:41 any of these what any of them go the
00:23:43 distance anyone go
00:23:45 20 30 40 years maybe yeah i would say i
00:23:47 would say they will definitely change
00:23:49 right and they well i think i think
00:23:51 winemakers in general have been
00:23:53 shifting to have their wines a lot more
00:23:55 approachable
00:23:56 when they're young than having it be
00:23:59 hard as nails
00:24:00 unapproachable closed in fact because
00:24:02 people don't have the discipline to
00:24:04 agent they don't have this money it
00:24:05 costs a lot of money
00:24:07 right yeah that's a lot of money and and
00:24:09 we're a restaurant that has wines like
00:24:11 2015
00:24:12 16 17. we're being
00:24:15 offered wines that are being released
00:24:17 into the market today
00:24:19 but we also have to sell it tomorrow if
00:24:22 that's the case
00:24:24 um and in order for a guest to come in
00:24:26 and enjoy their dining experience
00:24:29 maybe a little tough it's extremely
00:24:31 difficult to have those two things lined
00:24:33 up
00:24:34 where you're going to have a wonderful
00:24:35 dinner but i'm going to give you a wine
00:24:36 that's not ready to drink
00:24:38 you're not going to get anything out of
00:24:40 it in a bad situation right but the
00:24:41 responsibility of
00:24:43 sommelier or other other dynamics in the
00:24:45 restaurant may actually
00:24:47 mean that you're drinking wine that's
00:24:49 not quite ready to drink so give it some
00:24:51 time
00:24:51 give it a couple of years find a wine
00:24:54 that
00:24:55 has been aged of two or three years
00:24:58 in someone's cellar and then go for that
00:25:00 pull the cork you'll be rewarded i think
00:25:02 that's the joy of like celerying one
00:25:03 okay
00:25:04 let's compare this to the next one and
00:25:06 then i'm gonna i'm gonna
00:25:07 you know here's the thing with pairing
00:25:08 we can talk about the uh we just sent
00:25:10 some snacks this sort of
00:25:11 palette cleansers and whatnot we can get
00:25:13 into pairing a little bit this is a cool
00:25:15 little sheep's milk cheese from france
00:25:17 and um
00:25:18 it has a grassy note so if you if you
00:25:20 get a chance i would just encourage you
00:25:22 to have
00:25:22 a little bit of it with the wine and
00:25:24 then and then back to the cheese then
00:25:26 back to the wine and notice just the
00:25:28 cleansing effect of the wine
00:25:30 with the fattiness of the cheese that's
00:25:32 kind of a fun game that we like to play
00:25:33 here all the time but
00:25:34 um we can come back to it we're going to
00:25:36 leave some in our glass we're going to
00:25:37 study the way it changes a little bit
00:25:39 um even in just in the 45 minutes the
00:25:41 hour we have today
00:25:42 um but let's but take us to the next one
00:25:44 sick so this is now red burgundy
00:25:47 right so if white burgundy is always
00:25:48 chardonnay red burgundy is
00:25:51 almost always pinot noir and this is
00:25:53 claudia vous
00:25:55 so that's a vineyard now this is
00:25:57 probably one of the more
00:25:59 one of the largest it's actually the
00:26:01 largest grand cru winner that you'll
00:26:02 find in france
00:26:03 okay and in itself this is done by
00:26:05 chateau de la tour
00:26:09 pinot noir it's tricky in a sacred land
00:26:13 it's the queen of grapes i mean this is
00:26:15 this is the thing right like pinot noir
00:26:17 is really susceptible to a couple of
00:26:19 things right the vines themselves like
00:26:21 to change and morph into other grapes
00:26:23 right right like the different like and
00:26:25 then once you and then it's really
00:26:27 tricky
00:26:28 in the soil it's really finicky with the
00:26:30 air in the weather and then when you
00:26:31 pick it
00:26:32 it's really tricky to make into wine
00:26:34 right but it's the pinot noir is like
00:26:36 you're swinging for the fences
00:26:37 yeah in a certain sense uh because the
00:26:38 best ones are the best in the world and
00:26:40 probably you're in my opinion it's
00:26:42 rewarding and the most rewarding
00:26:44 but then like man you're hunting you had
00:26:46 a great pinot at some point
00:26:48 particularly a great burgundy in a
00:26:49 restaurant three years ago you might
00:26:50 spend 10 more years
00:26:52 hunting for a wine that is that magical
00:26:54 because um
00:26:55 it's it's easy to make a pinot it's
00:26:57 extremely difficult to make a very good
00:26:59 one
00:26:59 right and the great ones are just truly
00:27:01 so it's fun it's fun uh and
00:27:02 and i think burgundy when you think
00:27:05 burgundy makes the best peanut in the
00:27:06 world sort of hands down
00:27:07 unequivocally no one really debates that
00:27:09 is that you yeah well you know what
00:27:10 next week next thursday we're going to
00:27:12 have that that that discussion in that
00:27:14 debate we're calling it white wine
00:27:16 fight club yes we are we're calling it
00:27:18 fight so so two wines one old world one
00:27:20 new world
00:27:21 and if france or europe is the old world
00:27:23 we'll do two do you have
00:27:24 do you have an oregon pinot going
00:27:26 against anything in burgundy yeah we
00:27:27 have a snap
00:27:28 okay versus cool this is brainy cool
00:27:32 all right i'm so that'll be that'll be
00:27:34 fun that'll be
00:27:36 again an exercise where you get to try
00:27:38 two wines side by side
00:27:40 um of like starts so
00:27:43 great varieties are identical um but you
00:27:45 should be able to identify whether it's
00:27:48 terroir maybe or village in itself but
00:27:52 terrorists typically coming out of wine
00:27:54 from the old world um or
00:27:56 let's just say europe and sort of parts
00:27:58 over there and here's one of the reasons
00:27:59 why there's a ton of limestone
00:28:00 every wine maker in the world wants to
00:28:02 grow uh grapes
00:28:04 in limestone and say essentially you got
00:28:05 a layer of soil but underneath that
00:28:07 um you've got this limestone and it just
00:28:09 it does some awesome things for roots
00:28:11 it's hard to grow through
00:28:12 and yet it sort of strains the roots the
00:28:14 right amount allows the roots to go
00:28:15 super deep it gives it this chalky or
00:28:17 minerally or
00:28:18 soil flavor and what's crazy about it is
00:28:20 people like nelson
00:28:22 and all his friends can start to tell
00:28:23 you this limestone is from this hill
00:28:26 yeah this side of the valley oh yeah
00:28:27 that's more of the moral on that end
00:28:29 right
00:28:30 some ideas really do this and yeah so
00:28:32 why are you smelling that can i tell a
00:28:33 story yeah
00:28:34 you were recently at a little winery we
00:28:36 like to call domain
00:28:38 the romney county yeah yeah
00:28:41 one year ago this today so um
00:28:44 isn't it true that the winemaker you
00:28:47 know it's interesting you and i shared
00:28:48 this experience but like
00:28:49 like 20 years apart the reminder maker
00:28:52 asked you said hold on a second
00:28:53 here's your mic oh my mic disappeared to
00:28:55 get here
00:29:06 he disappears into the darkness of the
00:29:08 seller right and
00:29:10 he uh he comes back with a wine
00:29:13 he doesn't tell you what it is i've been
00:29:14 down right none of those brian's been
00:29:16 down and none of those
00:29:17 bottles were marked literally you're
00:29:18 like
00:29:20 one of the most coveted sellers on on
00:29:22 the planet yeah he comes back to the
00:29:23 wine
00:29:24 he pours it for you and doesn't he ask
00:29:26 you to tell him what it is
00:29:27 yeah he asks everyone there are five of
00:29:29 us in that circle and he asks each of us
00:29:31 what we which one we think it is
00:29:33 because he has six great vineyards seven
00:29:36 six something like that six seven yeah
00:29:38 so he's basically saying
00:29:40 nelson tell me the year and tell me
00:29:42 which vineyard
00:29:43 from my whole estate right you are a
00:29:46 little nervous are you just like i got
00:29:47 this well you know like you're
00:29:48 you're like that's your your own little
00:29:50 like
00:29:52 chapel right you're in the most sacred
00:29:55 you're in the sanctuary yeah like seller
00:29:58 um which is like an invite
00:30:01 only year-long wait list to get in you
00:30:04 know
00:30:05 approved and all these all these hoops
00:30:06 in circles that you have to just like
00:30:08 work your way through it and then i'm
00:30:10 just like like
00:30:11 just glad to be there happy to be have
00:30:14 been there
00:30:14 uh and then you get asked to like be put
00:30:18 on the spot
00:30:19 to identify a wine that doesn't have a
00:30:21 label on it and then of course like i'm
00:30:23 wondering
00:30:23 where's the wine maker yeah i'm like
00:30:25 yeah my god like did it i'm not gonna
00:30:28 what if i fail what happens when i fail
00:30:29 and call the wrong wine like what
00:30:31 did he just did we just all of us
00:30:33 totally and also why is he putting you
00:30:34 to this test this is like
00:30:36 this ostensibly this is not cool right
00:30:38 like i mean we do this in the wine
00:30:39 station all the time
00:30:40 because we're friends and it's like but
00:30:42 like he's a little
00:30:43 i kind of saw this as sort of this
00:30:45 paternal move i think he knew
00:30:47 i think he believed in you from the
00:30:48 get-go this is this is my
00:30:50 have i shared this with you i think he
00:30:52 was like this was like the ultimate
00:30:54 nelson you were the chosen one i don't
00:30:56 know i don't know this is i was like
00:30:58 very much a darth vader telling luke
00:31:00 skywalker you're my son
00:31:02 there was just this moment because we'll
00:31:04 get to the punch line
00:31:05 you crushed it you guessed it yeah we
00:31:08 all go around and say what we think it
00:31:10 is
00:31:11 uh what vintage and what vineyard yeah
00:31:13 and you know like one person goes and
00:31:15 calls
00:31:16 you know like a a young wine like a like
00:31:18 a 2012
00:31:20 um romani st vivant and and we all look
00:31:23 at i was like
00:31:24 like wrong vineyard it's too young rsv
00:31:27 you know like from 12 should taste a
00:31:29 little harder
00:31:30 and we all have like this internal clock
00:31:32 of like what it should taste like and
00:31:34 where it is which first of all the fact
00:31:35 that anyone knows what these wines taste
00:31:36 like is crazy because they're all
00:31:38 uh a couple thousand dollars a piece
00:31:40 right right or north of that
00:31:42 yeah yeah and it's silly you know you
00:31:43 don't get it it's not like we get a
00:31:44 chance to taste these all the time yeah
00:31:45 no one's really confirming everyone
00:31:47 wants
00:31:47 has a completely different answer we go
00:31:50 so i comes to me then i sort of like go
00:31:52 through the thought process of saying
00:31:54 just based off of what we're chasing
00:31:55 upstairs i'd like the elegance of this
00:31:57 vintage
00:31:58 or the vineyard i like the the hardiness
00:32:00 of the vintage
00:32:01 it's at this point angular so i'm going
00:32:04 through this rolodex of wines in my head
00:32:06 of what i've had recently what i've
00:32:09 tasted upstairs what i've done in the
00:32:10 cellar or
00:32:12 here in seattle uh and then i finally
00:32:14 deduced the winery come down and i said
00:32:16 this is 19.99
00:32:18 rich pork that's what it tastes like so
00:32:20 the year and the vineyard
00:32:23 and was it like smile just creep across
00:32:25 his lips he kind of did the nod
00:32:28 and that was the last one to go and then
00:32:31 go
00:32:31 well tell me again what everybody picked
00:32:34 and then we kind of do this like little
00:32:36 like i don't know like like yeah reveal
00:32:40 for
00:32:40 them show
00:32:47 for the record nelson did that and three
00:32:49 other wine cellars and burgundy that
00:32:51 same week so
00:32:52 you know he's good okay take us through
00:32:54 this one i i would not call this
00:32:56 like yeah you see how it just jumps out
00:32:58 of the glass
00:32:59 this is uh unmistakably pinot noir why
00:33:02 why do you say that
00:33:03 are you talking about the fruit you're
00:33:05 talking about the like uh what are you
00:33:06 getting it's unmistakable
00:33:08 does these uh um slightly
00:33:11 brambled red fruit i get red cherry i
00:33:14 get this red plum
00:33:16 raspberries and strawberry slightly
00:33:18 rambled by that i think it's code for
00:33:19 like those aren't blackberries
00:33:21 yeah yeah those would be heavily
00:33:22 brambled yeah yeah
00:33:25 it's lit lightly brambled yeah it's just
00:33:27 like a
00:33:28 marion barrier or something like was it
00:33:30 this right here
00:33:31 just i just want to call attention to
00:33:33 the fact you said slightly better that's
00:33:34 awesome no one really
00:33:35 i did okay cool okay yeah so so yeah so
00:33:38 not heavy
00:33:39 no no none of that but and it has a um
00:33:42 sort of like an ethereal lightness to
00:33:44 it right it's got um i guess the early
00:33:47 part
00:33:47 of leather and what starts to show me
00:33:49 some development into the wine
00:33:51 i get layers of spice behind it even
00:33:53 that leaky moist flavor that i got
00:33:55 wow no way where i get off of that like
00:33:58 just the plum thing salted plum okay huh
00:34:03 then behind that more of the red foam
00:34:04 being a good one because it can be sour
00:34:06 it can be sweet and you kind of like
00:34:08 you never quite know sometimes i get
00:34:10 cherry or sour cherry or like red
00:34:12 cherries
00:34:13 like a light floral note to it okay
00:34:15 violets
00:34:17 and when i think of and add those notes
00:34:19 up not the way i'm
00:34:21 juicing for um you know the grape in
00:34:23 itself but it smells like
00:34:24 wonderful wonderful glass of wine yeah
00:34:27 yeah and when i say it's obviously pinot
00:34:29 noir you know like i have those notes up
00:34:31 i look at the color it's a little more
00:34:33 subtle and nuanced as far as what wines
00:34:35 can be like
00:34:36 right and then you put it in your
00:34:38 palette
00:34:39 and they sort of like line up yeah yeah
00:34:43 go through your notes again of like red
00:34:46 fruits
00:34:46 right strawberries cherries red plum um
00:34:50 raspberries that light leather note they
00:34:52 kind of go down into this earthiness now
00:34:54 i get more mommy when i started to put
00:34:56 it on the palette after my first sip
00:34:58 yeah just coming up off the retro nasal
00:35:00 again starts to
00:35:01 get me again and i would say is this a
00:35:03 little cold
00:35:04 this is this is it's slightly cold
00:35:07 but this is actually really what you're
00:35:08 digging for so i kind of want to like i
00:35:10 kind of want to leave it and come back
00:35:12 what does this cost on on our on our so
00:35:15 2014 what does this cost
00:35:16 25 325 all right um so young so my
00:35:20 question
00:35:20 my question is is it is it worth it
00:35:22 right and and to me as i'm always
00:35:24 wondering like wow really going to
00:35:25 charge 325 for that
00:35:26 um this is remarkable and yet
00:35:30 not yet for me like i want it to just
00:35:32 like evolve a little yeah come back
00:35:35 to it yeah but but in terms of not
00:35:37 screwing it up and sometimes i feel
00:35:38 pinot can like really
00:35:40 like really easily yeah uh there's
00:35:42 nothing screwed up about like that one
00:35:43 is just like
00:35:44 right here at me um and also could
00:35:46 probably live
00:35:47 easily what another 20 years like built
00:35:51 built to last and you kind of get that
00:35:52 in the structure you kind of get that
00:35:54 in the um it's not it's not all fleshy
00:35:58 and losing itself right it's still it's
00:36:00 still completely
00:36:00 tanning and acidity play a huge role in
00:36:02 this wine acidity you get that sour note
00:36:05 to it right if you come back to it it
00:36:06 still has that pucker
00:36:07 sort of power and that sort of like that
00:36:09 thing behind it tannin
00:36:11 uh in itself can be like this long chain
00:36:14 or imagine it like in a look like an
00:36:16 accordion where
00:36:17 uh it's really just jagged and all of
00:36:20 this
00:36:21 stuck in the middle if the accordion is
00:36:23 tight right or
00:36:24 as you slowly open it up you see so many
00:36:26 layers
00:36:27 of of what's there um and you didn't
00:36:30 really
00:36:31 quite understand it when it's young and
00:36:33 and sort of like smushed together you go
00:36:35 right on the top
00:36:36 you sort of miss it you know it's there
00:36:38 because it's aggressive and it's like
00:36:39 but it's all competitive
00:36:40 yeah and it's compact and the more you
00:36:42 open it up you start to see
00:36:43 all the little valleys the peaks and
00:36:45 valleys of of a long
00:36:47 stretched accordion and and it leaves
00:36:50 your palate just sort of like
00:36:52 this is what's fun about tannins in pina
00:36:54 right is that you're not like getting
00:36:56 slapped up the face like so many new
00:36:58 world
00:36:58 larger larger bodied reds um hopefully
00:37:01 here we just have this like elongated
00:37:04 elegant that's why they call it the
00:37:05 queen of wines she's powerful she's
00:37:07 elegant
00:37:08 she's sophisticated you're just like in
00:37:10 awe of her
00:37:11 staring there your jaw down on the
00:37:12 ground and um and hopefully
00:37:15 you're getting this um kind of velvety
00:37:17 smoother
00:37:18 uh longer lasting sort of tannic
00:37:20 experience as opposed to sort of these
00:37:21 map
00:37:22 this monster not that not that the great
00:37:25 big reds can't do that but sometimes i
00:37:27 feel like
00:37:28 uh they're always aspiring to do what a
00:37:30 pinot does yeah
00:37:32 and only a few get there i just want to
00:37:35 eat some of this because i love it so
00:37:36 far
00:37:37 and uh well you know like i'm not going
00:37:38 to mess this up but we have the benefit
00:37:40 here of having more glass or two so
00:37:42 let's bring them up and i'll record the
00:37:43 next one
00:37:44 you know one other thing i want to say
00:37:45 the last part about like claudiberan and
00:37:46 chlorophyll are closed all together
00:37:48 you'll see that word around
00:37:50 c-l-o-s means enclosure in french so
00:37:53 khloe
00:37:54 uh and originally it meant a wall the
00:37:56 vineyard so
00:37:58 when you when you travel out to france
00:38:00 and you go to a cloak
00:38:01 they will have these vineyards that are
00:38:05 that are uh that are protected by
00:38:08 a wall that's been built up by old brick
00:38:10 and really what they're looking for is
00:38:12 saying that
00:38:12 they need to have in order to be a clo
00:38:16 that wall high enough that a rider on a
00:38:19 horse
00:38:20 could wouldn't be able to go over that
00:38:22 one that's that's that's a technical
00:38:24 definition of a cloak that's how we know
00:38:26 this is not a new law
00:38:28 enclosed vineyard yeah with this next
00:38:31 wine we don't have the bottle with us
00:38:34 but let's just say why is it true we
00:38:37 actually threw them all we recycled them
00:38:38 all
00:38:39 yeah well we believe in recycling we do
00:38:41 that's who we are
00:38:42 um we just recycle all of my day before
00:38:45 too soon all right so talk about this
00:38:48 the 2003
00:38:50 all right so when we say mootom we're uh
00:38:51 short for mouton rothschild yep
00:38:53 uh it is considered one of the five
00:38:57 it's one of the big guys of at bordeaux
00:39:00 park
00:39:01 yeah one of the five first girls on
00:39:02 bordeaux first growth according to
00:39:04 napoleon or according to this
00:39:06 classification back in 1855
00:39:09 based on quality and price that they
00:39:10 were gaining or fetching in the market
00:39:14 and um there are those who believe
00:39:17 that it's hyped up and a little
00:39:19 overrated and come on
00:39:21 really you can't do that napoleon have
00:39:23 it still mattered today
00:39:24 there are others who hunt these wines
00:39:26 their entire lives um and aspire to
00:39:28 drink one
00:39:29 and collect them and uh and sort of get
00:39:32 into this the power and the beauty of
00:39:34 them
00:39:34 um which side i know which side you're
00:39:37 on
00:39:38 if you get a chance uh it's kind of to
00:39:40 kind of taste through all five
00:39:42 of them um it ends up being pretty
00:39:44 remarkably special and
00:39:45 it's amazing that they have done this
00:39:48 year after year after year
00:39:49 decade after decade now century after
00:39:50 century like it's it's a stunning thing
00:39:52 and it doesn't mean there's not amazing
00:39:54 wine out there but they they have earned
00:39:56 their place right right and when i look
00:39:58 at all the other tiers and all the other
00:39:59 first growths
00:40:00 i've you know like had experience where
00:40:02 i say like you know the tour can be
00:40:04 the most powerful and always in great
00:40:06 vintages be
00:40:07 more outstanding shots of obreon from
00:40:10 the cell
00:40:11 one my favorite rustic earthy um
00:40:14 where's margo sit where argo is elegant
00:40:17 okay always refined okay like tannins
00:40:20 that maybe come around a little
00:40:21 easier so softer on the palette what
00:40:23 with a great nose okay
00:40:24 um what would what else don't look now
00:40:26 but a good looking man is putting a new
00:40:28 microphone on his shoulders
00:40:30 i think our microphones are dying yeah
00:40:32 okay thank you thanks
00:40:34 and then i would say that um so what do
00:40:37 we got we got latour
00:40:38 the tourists um uh the one that we don't
00:40:41 have
00:40:42 a little um so this is mouton yeah
00:40:45 we don't have much of but i love the
00:40:47 tour is is the powerful one that has
00:40:49 that goes the distance
00:40:50 and it's just gonna be striking yeah but
00:40:53 mutant talk about mutants
00:40:55 their jam before i get there the feet
00:40:57 that shares the same
00:40:58 last name but not associated with each
00:41:00 other so defeat
00:41:02 rothschild or the royal shield that
00:41:04 would be one that i always see as just a
00:41:06 step behind the tour as far as what
00:41:08 depth can
00:41:08 be like but in years be
00:41:12 um be incredible yeah yeah be even even
00:41:15 more exceptional
00:41:17 um across the board and when i get from
00:41:19 mouton
00:41:20 now is again maybe the most consistent
00:41:23 wine that's around
00:41:24 yeah of the first growth something that
00:41:26 i can rely on year after year
00:41:30 one that i always feel like is going to
00:41:32 was to deliver this is these are
00:41:34 expensive wines this goes for 1800 on
00:41:37 our list
00:41:39 exactly can i take that back actually
00:41:42 this was
00:41:43 this was the wine that really this is
00:41:45 the one yeah the centerpiece of the
00:41:47 entire
00:41:48 tasting it is one that we have i had a
00:41:51 case of in the cellar
00:41:53 to begin with and everything else fell
00:41:55 built around was built around it
00:41:57 it was a case of wine that i remember
00:41:59 buying
00:42:00 back in the day oh you remember buying
00:42:02 it yeah with philip yes
00:42:03 now we got offered and it was um coming
00:42:06 direct from the distributor and this was
00:42:08 after we we weren't in a place to sort
00:42:10 of like buy a whole lot of first girls
00:42:12 and really
00:42:13 really had a seller full of wines and
00:42:15 our budget wasn't
00:42:17 they're buying power at that point we're
00:42:18 like i don't know if this is the right
00:42:20 direction
00:42:20 the buying power around here was low and
00:42:22 we had this sort of stereotype yeah yeah
00:42:24 but let's get it yeah and this was 2006.
00:42:31 or even that no it was 2008 because it
00:42:33 was a decision that philip and i
00:42:35 looked at and said do we can we afford
00:42:37 to buy this it was that
00:42:39 it was in the hardest times of looking
00:42:41 at the restaurant
00:42:42 when we uh when you first pitched this
00:42:44 idea and we were going through the
00:42:45 upstairs that all the community college
00:42:47 classes and whatnot and he said no i'm
00:42:49 gonna anchor this with a really special
00:42:50 line
00:42:51 um there was something in me that that
00:42:54 kind of
00:42:55 that kind of leaped for joy they kind of
00:42:56 smiled because um
00:42:59 okay here we are a lot of pivots in if
00:43:01 you will to use that word again
00:43:03 uh here we are sort of changing the
00:43:04 company up in a lot of different ways we
00:43:06 did this
00:43:08 goofy and also hopefully fun and
00:43:10 encouraging community college thing
00:43:12 and this to me felt like whoa wait a
00:43:15 second we're opening mouton
00:43:16 we're putting it in the in little in
00:43:18 bottles we're putting in a cardboard box
00:43:20 we're sending it to people's homes and
00:43:22 to me it was like the christening
00:43:23 or the embracing or somehow um
00:43:26 the accepting of uh and life goes on
00:43:30 yeah right like we didn't think when we
00:43:32 made a burger store
00:43:33 uh out of this place um eight months ago
00:43:35 that we'd that we're doing this right
00:43:37 now
00:43:37 right and we are wanting to become a
00:43:39 restaurant again
00:43:40 and it was kind of like you know what uh
00:43:43 the seller is down here
00:43:44 let's share it with people it's friday
00:43:46 night it's post-election
00:43:48 it or i don't know if that thing's still
00:43:50 going probably check the news today but
00:43:51 like
00:43:52 it feels to me like we're entering into
00:43:54 a new season and it feels to me like
00:43:56 it's okay
00:43:57 it's okay to open a special bottle it's
00:43:59 okay to raise a glass
00:44:00 it's okay to say uh here you know cheers
00:44:03 yeah a toast
00:44:05 this is to us getting this far or this
00:44:07 is to us
00:44:08 embracing what we have to be thankful
00:44:09 for or this is to us
00:44:11 entering into a weekend and and to me
00:44:13 that's that is what wine is doing
00:44:15 it's not that we're celebrating the wine
00:44:17 it's the wine is celebrating
00:44:19 us like it is it is uplifting the people
00:44:21 around the table and
00:44:23 what they're going through and um and so
00:44:25 anyway i just it kind of warned me to be
00:44:27 like you know what
00:44:28 let's do it like let's drink mouton
00:44:30 let's just do it on a on a canvas
00:44:32 community college call and make this
00:44:33 thing happen so
00:44:34 cheers i'm glad that we're very excited
00:44:36 this is this
00:44:38 is exceptional right i mean this this is
00:44:41 a wine
00:44:42 that um you know i've tasted over the
00:44:46 years
00:44:46 and many times through uh and for what
00:44:50 this vintage
00:44:51 came out to be as is a really one of one
00:44:53 of the hottest years on record
00:44:55 on record in bordeaux at the time um
00:45:00 you remember what was happening or sort
00:45:02 of like not that nothing we all remember
00:45:04 but
00:45:04 one of the more tragic things was that
00:45:06 the heat wave that came through
00:45:08 uh that killed people around the country
00:45:10 in france
00:45:11 and um and here we are drinking wines or
00:45:14 grapes
00:45:15 from a vineyard that is hotter than
00:45:17 normal
00:45:18 and cabernet sauvignon something that
00:45:19 can take the heat and absorb all that
00:45:21 flavor
00:45:22 but in the end is it gonna make wines
00:45:23 that last yeah
00:45:25 right that relationship between acidity
00:45:28 tannin
00:45:29 and uh and sugar all play a big role in
00:45:32 it
00:45:32 in in wine making cabernet can
00:45:36 is maybe the best example of what that
00:45:38 all looks like uh the warmer in the
00:45:40 house
00:45:40 the ability to go the distance when we
00:45:42 talk about bordeaux we're looking at
00:45:44 five traditional grapes i was really in
00:45:46 cabernet sauvignon
00:45:47 looking at merlot cabernet franc uh
00:45:50 malbec petit verdo right
00:45:52 and sort of almost in that order and and
00:45:54 this being on what the left bank
00:45:56 were predominantly cabernet sauvignon
00:45:58 right and merlot what else is in here
00:46:01 yeah kev frank and kevin okay yeah so uh
00:46:04 these are
00:46:04 these are um varietals that forever in a
00:46:07 day have been going together each plays
00:46:08 a specific role but particularly
00:46:10 cabernet is sort of the
00:46:12 the backbone of this thing and it's
00:46:13 giving the wine its structure
00:46:15 its power yeah a lot of explain
00:46:17 longevity
00:46:18 right and it's just something that they
00:46:20 that they crush down there right over
00:46:21 there
00:46:22 i mean like so what are you smelling
00:46:23 this what are you what are you getting
00:46:24 oh
00:46:25 god i'm like so ready to drink it so
00:46:26 you're kind of killing me here i go
00:46:27 let's let's do it
00:46:28 i've already got into it i sent some to
00:46:30 him and if two this is for you
00:46:32 because you sir joined our team in the
00:46:35 middle of a pandemic and i want to thank
00:46:36 you for that
00:46:37 um welcome to seattle this is how we
00:46:40 roll
00:46:40 um okay what are you smelling i get more
00:46:43 black fruits
00:46:43 right identifying with something that's
00:46:46 um
00:46:47 like riper in style okay so i get is it
00:46:49 jammy is it jam ripe or just
00:46:52 like what are the fruits even you know i
00:46:54 guess sort of like
00:46:55 ripeness your doughnut uh like a baked
00:46:58 quality
00:46:58 to it okay right like that baked plum
00:47:01 right black plum blackberries
00:47:03 um sort of like that that blueberry note
00:47:06 even
00:47:08 blueberry being yeah like the intensity
00:47:10 of the color and also just like
00:47:11 the exoticness of the the darkness of
00:47:14 that fruit
00:47:15 i get blackberry for sure yeah and then
00:47:17 you know aft after you get all this
00:47:18 fruit
00:47:19 now this is a wine that's what 17 years
00:47:21 old now
00:47:22 you start to see and this is bordeaux
00:47:25 you start to see that
00:47:26 that mid-stage of development um
00:47:29 in a wine like these are like you're
00:47:31 starting to get secondary things that
00:47:33 come out of it things that you could
00:47:34 only get
00:47:34 with time and age right those tertiary
00:47:37 notes right
00:47:38 let's go deeper now like once you start
00:47:40 to smell them let's go again
00:47:44 you know when i talked about leather
00:47:45 early on what i'm finding here in
00:47:48 burgundy sure
00:47:49 this one's just a little more of that
00:47:51 used leather where it's not
00:47:53 up front and an an aggressive or
00:47:55 abrasive you can get a new filter bag
00:47:57 this is this is a this vintage feels
00:47:59 vintage
00:48:02 same with you right like it's not all up
00:48:04 in your face it's not this is not
00:48:06 new and toasty in your face all of these
00:48:08 things with time
00:48:09 they start to mellow they start to
00:48:11 integrate they start to come together
00:48:13 in a way that and that's what we're
00:48:15 saying we're saying tertiary we're like
00:48:16 wait a second like
00:48:17 things actually happened in the bottle
00:48:19 after the last so many years right
00:48:21 and created new flavors it didn't smell
00:48:23 like leather when it was first putting
00:48:24 out
00:48:25 like a little bit of this is a little
00:48:26 like more of the season two
00:48:28 right go outside walk through go go to
00:48:31 discovery park
00:48:32 walk through trails you get that that
00:48:35 sort of like
00:48:36 earthy quality to it that sort of like
00:48:39 fresh co
00:48:40 you know like a little like earth like
00:48:41 wet or like stepped on leaves that sort
00:48:44 of like
00:48:44 um like not maybe just just not that
00:48:47 that soil but maybe this like
00:48:49 mushroomy quality where it's something
00:48:54 you know like a little fall yeah and and
00:48:56 that's what you
00:48:57 that's what you're paying for well yeah
00:49:02 leather and fall yeah but like but it's
00:49:04 weird but those flavors are not
00:49:05 something you can just pluck
00:49:07 off of a vine right crush those are the
00:49:09 things that a very skilled winemaker
00:49:12 knew with the amount of each varietal to
00:49:15 stick it in there
00:49:16 given the weather that you're saying wow
00:49:19 you know this is the weather did this to
00:49:20 the cab it did this to the cab franc it
00:49:22 did this to like
00:49:24 right and then they just they mix it
00:49:25 different every time it's not like every
00:49:27 time it's 88
00:49:28 22 right they have a formula um and
00:49:31 they'll do the final blend based on
00:49:32 what's available to them they'll go in
00:49:34 like a team like we would here go
00:49:37 through trials come up with a final
00:49:38 blend
00:49:39 but really what they have in the end is
00:49:41 how much vineyards
00:49:43 grapes planted to to the variety in
00:49:46 itself that they can
00:49:47 they can afford to put in the final
00:49:48 blend so a lot of times you'll see
00:49:50 like this is what 76 cabernet sauvignon
00:49:54 yeah they'll go between you know like
00:49:55 low 70s or mid 70s and like this to
00:49:58 the low 80s but that's just based on
00:50:00 whatever is available
00:50:01 from the season and then what makes
00:50:03 sense in the final blend
00:50:05 sure mouton and like other first growths
00:50:07 these wines are meant
00:50:08 to age right even in 2003 now in a warm
00:50:12 vintage look at what we have here
00:50:13 a wine that's show development tendon
00:50:16 that's tapered off
00:50:18 a city that's still lively and embracing
00:50:20 the wine
00:50:21 but it allows you to explore all the
00:50:24 other
00:50:25 tertiary notes and the development of
00:50:27 what the wine can offer
00:50:28 yeah which is cool so yeah the fruit
00:50:31 that you get
00:50:32 just like um it's it's really
00:50:34 approachable
00:50:35 it's there it's readily available it's
00:50:37 not hiding itself it doesn't have a much
00:50:38 a structure and tan and other things
00:50:40 that are sort of like
00:50:41 closing it if you will right it's right
00:50:44 it's available
00:50:45 and um yeah and easy in that way
00:50:48 right fun so let's be an example of what
00:50:50 what bordeaux
00:50:51 high level high quality bordeaux is like
00:50:54 like you don't want to like
00:50:55 hold onto a bottle so cherish and price
00:50:58 that you forget to open it because you
00:50:59 think
00:51:00 all these expectations are put on a
00:51:02 bottle like this yeah if you miss a wine
00:51:04 like this because you
00:51:05 were waiting for that right moment
00:51:07 you're going to miss out on an
00:51:08 exceptional bottle of wine
00:51:10 that has so much to offer i think you've
00:51:12 also just struck on a metaphor for life
00:51:15 there it is yeah yeah i mean that that
00:51:18 principle just applies to so many things
00:51:19 right and it's like it'd be better
00:51:21 to go for it to open it and to celebrate
00:51:24 today
00:51:24 what you have now than to be thinking oh
00:51:27 i'm waiting
00:51:28 i'm i'm waiting for my ship to come in
00:51:30 i'm waiting for something in the future
00:51:31 like
00:51:31 go ahead and do it and we are going to
00:51:33 find ourselves in that position not just
00:51:35 because we're
00:51:36 still wine for a living but all the time
00:51:38 with people saying hey
00:51:39 go for it like tonight like it's okay
00:51:42 open it there's gonna be another bottle
00:51:44 that you put
00:51:44 on that pedestal that you'll celebrate
00:51:46 with and have that
00:51:48 lifeline be a little shorter now if this
00:51:51 is something we've sell it for 17 years
00:51:53 or in reality you know like 12 13 years
00:51:57 this is in this drinking window can it
00:52:00 age longer absolutely i wouldn't
00:52:01 start popping every other three but oh
00:52:03 threes now are drinking well
00:52:06 now's the time to start drinking that
00:52:07 where it delivers the fruit's still
00:52:09 there
00:52:10 it's tapering off with tannin um it's
00:52:12 it's
00:52:13 uh do you expect it to get better is the
00:52:15 question just you ask yourself
00:52:16 if you want to hold on to it it's like
00:52:19 cool maybe a little
00:52:20 but is it going to get better than where
00:52:22 it's drinking today and in this moment
00:52:24 i wouldn't maybe a little maybe how good
00:52:27 is this
00:52:28 right now where is it so maybe it gets
00:52:30 more subtle maybe it grows some of that
00:52:32 sort of barn earth and tertiary note
00:52:34 kind of thing but with that maybe you
00:52:36 lose some of the fruit and
00:52:37 and so look if you're into sort of like
00:52:40 the super funk
00:52:41 um tired is the wrong word but uh but
00:52:44 very mature and
00:52:46 sort of laid back old man wine cool
00:52:49 um but if you still want to have some of
00:52:51 its uh initial and original integrity
00:52:53 you just gotta find that spot right
00:52:55 that's also the advantage of a small
00:52:56 yeah you just get to come up and say
00:52:58 this is what i want you to go find a
00:52:59 bottle and um everyone's asking
00:53:01 what will happen to russia you know
00:53:02 we've got the cool at the end of this
00:53:04 but
00:53:04 this this like be me in a sommelier um
00:53:07 recently even in the last like few days
00:53:09 of just like hearing all the things that
00:53:11 come with it and the responsibility of
00:53:12 it
00:53:13 being cool about it not abusing your
00:53:15 power to get or or leverage for what
00:53:18 what you're looking for what you want
00:53:19 but having just like the absolute joy
00:53:21 and privilege to serve guests
00:53:23 more than like in turn sharing something
00:53:25 that
00:53:26 that hundred dollars and they give us a
00:53:29 splash of wine they give us an ounce of
00:53:31 water
00:53:31 that's that's uh beyond generous what
00:53:34 they're also telling you is that like
00:53:36 i i'm investing in you and you're in
00:53:38 your palette and i want you to be the
00:53:40 professional that gets the chance to try
00:53:42 something like this because
00:53:44 i can't afford to buy a wine like this
00:53:47 as often as they do right yeah um you
00:53:50 know like the trips to the drc and
00:53:52 mostly
00:53:52 no expectation to it either and i think
00:53:54 some people are sitting at the table
00:53:56 saying
00:53:56 am i supposed to like give this guy some
00:53:58 mine no no no no no
00:54:00 you're not it's a relationship you start
00:54:03 you have to build it if you're
00:54:04 at a place where you're at a restaurant
00:54:06 you have it like that's that's
00:54:07 a certain courtesy that you're going to
00:54:09 give the sommelier but it's not expected
00:54:11 but when you find that in fact if it is
00:54:13 expected somewhere
00:54:14 that's not your family oh like they're
00:54:16 literally like yeah
00:54:18 that's dirty like honestly it should
00:54:20 what are they going to beg for
00:54:21 it should never feel that way and the
00:54:23 testimony the silly the little thing
00:54:24 that the
00:54:25 the cups those days are gone
00:54:28 and and if they're not and you find
00:54:30 yourself in a situation where it all you
00:54:31 feel that pressure
00:54:33 um you you know get out of it that's
00:54:34 yeah i think what happens is
00:54:37 at some point you're drinking a lot of
00:54:39 wine and
00:54:40 maybe you've had this relationship with
00:54:41 someone at the table and you're just
00:54:42 like it would be way more fun
00:54:44 um to actually have you like
00:54:48 enjoy this with me and then i think it
00:54:50 when it's
00:54:51 of relationship then that's the thing
00:54:52 that's the spirit in that place then
00:54:53 yeah absolutely there's no expectation
00:54:55 right all right take us through this
00:54:56 because this has got to okay this you
00:54:58 stick your nose in here and it's hard
00:54:59 not to like it right
00:55:00 it's just like so that we talk about
00:55:02 like let's talk about progression and of
00:55:04 the day and of the night and if this was
00:55:05 the anchor the last one the mouton
00:55:08 um like we're we're climbing now we're
00:55:10 building this

00:56:35 was super into it i think about her
00:56:36 learning about napa
00:56:38 yeah i mean today i mean its first
00:56:40 vintage was in 79
00:56:41 and let's think about where it is today
00:56:43 and how it got there right
00:56:45 modeled off of bordeaux yeah um so when
00:56:48 ordering
00:56:48 in america do bordeaux the way bordeaux
00:56:50 does it correct yeah yeah
00:56:52 yeah i mean you you're proud that you
00:56:54 want to say napa valley can
00:56:56 can do that and keep up because we have
00:56:58 cabernet sauvignon
00:56:59 and we are like we're gonna we're gonna
00:57:02 try we're
00:57:03 we have um all these things that try to
00:57:05 replicate what's happening in bordeaux
00:57:07 um let's do uh let's do our version of
00:57:10 it but what
00:57:10 robert mondavi did was pair up with
00:57:13 baron phillippe
00:57:14 uh russia so that what they can do is
00:57:18 create
00:57:18 this awesome awesome brand that they can
00:57:21 link up together
00:57:23 and and have what's called then a joint
00:57:25 project
00:57:26 opus one down in napa mondavi being one
00:57:28 of the the godfathers
00:57:29 of wine in our country certainly in napa
00:57:32 valley
00:57:33 um for a lot of reasons a a remarkable
00:57:35 human being
00:57:36 um and just his role in the community
00:57:38 but also a visionary
00:57:40 in the wine world and here he is
00:57:41 partnering up with one of the great
00:57:43 families
00:57:43 of france and it's sort of like i don't
00:57:45 know if we had tabloids or if we had
00:57:47 um sort of paparazzi in this country
00:57:49 that would be like a big deal like
00:57:50 seeing them hang out together and it was
00:57:51 for a long time down there and
00:57:53 uh and here it is like here's one of the
00:57:55 i don't know one of the
00:57:57 the big heavy hitters from from napa
00:57:59 yeah with a little bit of cloud this is
00:58:00 not these are not the newcomers this is
00:58:02 not something
00:58:03 that's popped up there's one one that
00:58:05 can keep up with
00:58:06 with its tradition or then its history
00:58:09 of making wine
00:58:10 all these years uh this has one of the
00:58:12 longest track records of it
00:58:14 right not the not the screaming eagles
00:58:16 or like
00:58:17 you know the newer wineries today which
00:58:20 are who were just banking on the
00:58:21 reputation
00:58:22 of what opus one was in the past um
00:58:23 there are plenty of wineries and they're
00:58:25 all fantastic but this one here has said
00:58:27 um i'm going to continue to produce wine
00:58:30 in a way that's sort of a reflection of
00:58:31 bordeaux
00:58:32 esque in the mentality of doing it but
00:58:34 with the best of what napa has to offer
00:58:36 and this is okay so i've been
00:58:38 complimentary to it yeah
00:58:40 can we just can we just be real yeah
00:58:43 it's not my jam
00:58:44 okay yeah it smells like jam dude so you
00:58:46 stick your nose in this i think and
00:58:47 you're just like oh
00:58:48 wine and so many people i don't know how
00:58:51 you can smell that and not just
00:58:52 want to like it right yeah but then um
00:58:55 for me
00:58:56 it's a monster yeah it's huge i mean
00:58:58 here we are coming off of these sort of
00:59:00 subtle things i just went back and
00:59:01 smelled
00:59:02 a couple of these and i would encourage
00:59:04 you to like go back to the peanut go
00:59:05 back to the burgundy
00:59:06 um and just like compare the two
00:59:09 one um one smells american it is brash
00:59:13 and big
00:59:14 and bold and in your face and it's like
00:59:16 tada here i am it's got the jazz hands
00:59:19 out right
00:59:19 the other one is the mirror it's sitting
00:59:22 back smoking a cigarette
00:59:23 uh on a park bench just like very short
00:59:26 of of itself and so
00:59:28 um only it doesn't smell like smoke and
00:59:29 so to me when i put this to me it needs
00:59:33 10 more years yeah to chill the heck out
00:59:36 yeah integrate a little bit and come
00:59:40 down and i think it's going to be but
00:59:41 but i would call this too young am i am
00:59:43 i off or am i that just
00:59:45 this is this is young this is a young
00:59:46 youthful wine i put 03 and 15
00:59:49 side by side one old world compare but i
00:59:52 also picked
00:59:53 um vintages that were similar um this is
00:59:56 the one
00:59:56 this is a warm vintage a ripe year
01:00:01 tv down sector seven so warm vintage
01:00:03 meaning a lot of sun
01:00:04 changing that grape uh changing whatever
01:00:07 is in the grape correct
01:00:08 into sugar right yeah we're getting yeah
01:00:10 less acid typically more sugar
01:00:11 and you get sort of like that same
01:00:13 quality right so think about our notes
01:00:15 back
01:00:16 um when we were doing the mouton where
01:00:19 we were saying
01:00:19 baked quality of them right whether it's
01:00:21 plum
01:00:22 blackberry blueberry all these things
01:00:24 you get that here
01:00:26 they're still baked but when you called
01:00:28 it to be jammy it's almost like it's
01:00:29 been stewed just a little bit as well
01:00:31 yeah it reminds me of making we make
01:00:33 blackberry jam everywhere my wife does
01:00:35 and it's just like yep this is what the
01:00:36 house smells like when you're making
01:00:37 blackberry right now imagine just like
01:00:39 going and get oak chips from
01:00:41 from the yard something they would use
01:00:42 in the smoker and you throw that in
01:00:43 there or you're just like but
01:00:44 i get this sense though and am i wrong
01:00:48 that in 30 years
01:00:51 this is bombing yeah like right so
01:00:54 there's some of the some of the bigness
01:00:56 and the power
01:00:57 and and for me just sort of like there
01:01:00 are
01:01:01 it it tames and yet it has the ability
01:01:03 like i think
01:01:04 i think all of that the alcohol feels to
01:01:07 me a little bit higher in here
01:01:08 we would say it's kind of hot um you
01:01:10 kind of get that perception of it
01:01:12 it feels to me like all of its power and
01:01:14 all of its structure and
01:01:15 frankly it kind of needs that alcohol to
01:01:17 carry everything else that's going on so
01:01:19 i don't think it's out of balance
01:01:21 i just want to try it yeah 10 to 30
01:01:23 years down yeah i think it's me
01:01:25 and um yeah truth advertising i've
01:01:28 gotten to try these really old and
01:01:29 they're
01:01:30 and they're insane they blow my mind
01:01:31 it's kind of cool to see them to see
01:01:33 them do that yeah and that evolution of
01:01:35 wine and maybe in the new world it's
01:01:36 easier to track because we've had a
01:01:38 longer
01:01:39 drinking history and relationship with
01:01:40 them so having older vintages of opus is
01:01:43 something that maybe we've seen around a
01:01:44 lot
01:01:45 because they were always one of
01:01:47 america's best wines
01:01:49 uh like you know for example like cool
01:01:50 city creek even for something local
01:01:52 we've created year after year of like
01:01:54 what it looks like to be coming from
01:01:56 79 or 81 right now yeah 1990 right
01:02:00 2015. right it's going to be insane yeah
01:02:02 and they continue to evolve and
01:02:04 deliver yeah you know with a young wine
01:02:07 like this
01:02:08 take it for what it's worth right what's
01:02:09 in the glass big
01:02:11 powerful bold wines need some time get
01:02:14 it decanted open it up
01:02:16 but on the palate powerful richly
01:02:18 flavored um
01:02:20 and almost creamy in the back end and
01:02:22 then there's this tenon
01:02:23 that kind of grabs you and says it has
01:02:25 all of that yeah yeah so give me
01:02:27 like come back in five years like just
01:02:30 kind of says like
01:02:31 i'm not quite ready yet but i'm good
01:02:33 right now am i yeah
01:02:35 this is to me like come back i'm
01:02:36 drinking cards i'm not eating food
01:02:38 i just want to drink red wine and enjoy
01:02:41 it like this
01:02:42 you know what i'm saying like uh did you
01:02:44 say i'm drinking carrots i'm playing
01:02:45 cards
01:02:45 i like drinking cards i haven't even
01:02:47 finished those
01:02:49 but to me these wines be way easier to
01:02:52 pair food with
01:02:53 yeah um because they're going to be a
01:02:55 little more
01:02:56 um withheld not so in your face
01:02:59 over here maybe we're we're eating
01:03:02 something
01:03:03 big and gamey right this is a this is a
01:03:05 lamb chop on the grill i've got
01:03:07 smoke and i've got like big flavors and
01:03:09 i'm going after it
01:03:11 um but we start to pair this maybe uh
01:03:13 with some of the more subtle or delicate
01:03:14 things
01:03:15 it starts to almost overpower the food
01:03:17 and then it gets lost yeah you get the
01:03:18 egg
01:03:19 you can get lost but cool ah
01:03:23 there's a threshold i think within all
01:03:25 of us about where we want tendon to be
01:03:27 where we want
01:03:28 um alcohol to be or that or oak
01:03:32 this is definitely on the spectrum of
01:03:34 like young youthful
01:03:35 give it some time have it resolve itself
01:03:38 but a wine like this
01:03:39 it's meant to age so well when you get
01:03:41 it young get it decanted
01:03:43 and when you want to drink something
01:03:45 like this yeah i was splashing
01:03:46 with it so we're not so we're not
01:03:48 against on this one we're not decanting
01:03:49 to pull
01:03:50 the wine off the sediment you guys will
01:03:52 see here that we we keep our bottles
01:03:54 at whatever angle this is right so if we
01:03:56 were to pull one of these just to go
01:03:58 over it
01:03:59 here we come and the bottle's just
01:04:01 sitting at this angle right and so
01:04:02 hopefully our sediment is here
01:04:04 and we'd be pulling the one off but if
01:04:06 nelson were to can't
01:04:07 this one would you not just take it and
01:04:10 dump it upside down you literally are
01:04:11 trying
01:04:12 to splash it into the decanter to
01:04:13 agitate it and to get all that air yeah
01:04:15 and i'm even going to come back to it a
01:04:17 little bit because i think it's just
01:04:18 going to like
01:04:18 it's going to do awesome things yeah
01:04:20 it'll only breathe a little bit yeah
01:04:23 take us through the last line and if you
01:04:25 haven't had a chance you know to refresh
01:04:26 your palette you guys because we've got
01:04:28 a lot going on here
01:04:29 um grab one of those pickles okay get an
01:04:32 olive
01:04:32 like get something salty that gets your
01:04:34 mouth just salivating and you're just
01:04:36 gonna pull
01:04:37 everything going clean up and and go
01:04:40 fresh
01:04:43 there we go
01:04:47 so yeah those are good olives
01:04:50 um but they kind of start fresh you can
01:04:54 get
01:04:54 palette fatigue and when you're when
01:04:56 you're having some awesome wines like
01:04:58 this
01:04:59 man you want to you want to get it
01:05:00 either you don't want to just like
01:05:01 slowly degrade your palette so that
01:05:03 everything kind of tastes the same
01:05:07 how's that microphone going yeah almost
01:05:09 there
01:05:10 if you haven't had a chance to do so so
01:05:11 i just had an old i'm going to go all
01:05:12 the way back to the first one
01:05:14 to the shard from burgundy and just kind
01:05:16 of
01:05:17 stick your nose in it now see what's
01:05:19 going on with that it's completely
01:05:21 different to me now
01:05:22 than it was even what are we now 40
01:05:24 minutes and 40 no we're
01:05:26 six we're 60 minutes and we're coming up
01:05:28 to the hour um
01:05:29 but like to me that's so fun now and
01:05:32 even
01:05:33 um i mean i i drink white wine
01:05:36 with everything but uh to me to have
01:05:38 some chicory some cheese
01:05:40 some salty olives and pickles this is
01:05:42 just like a no-brainer the white smells
01:05:43 a little more oaky
01:05:44 the pinot is like glorious the mutant
01:05:49 there smells funky and dirty that's cool
01:05:51 and then the opus is like
01:05:53 like this reminds you it's just a baby
01:05:56 tonight at 10 p.m
01:05:58 yeah save some in your class and then
01:06:00 and then like raise a glass tomato
01:06:01 because you're gonna thank me it's going
01:06:03 to be
01:06:03 it's just it's just these times needs to
01:06:05 open up okay let's just talk about
01:06:06 horsepower
01:06:08 this is like a wine that i've been
01:06:10 looking forward
01:06:11 to tasting um i've tried it a few times
01:06:15 before
01:06:16 but we're getting this from magnum now
01:06:18 so this is
01:06:19 one that was um this is our hometown
01:06:22 wine
01:06:23 this is our walla walla these are our
01:06:24 boys yeah so this is my christophe baron
01:06:28 who makes caillous uh and he has done
01:06:31 different projects along the way
01:06:33 in order to continue to expand his uh
01:06:36 expand his brand
01:06:37 um and i think that's just a genius move
01:06:39 and within it then
01:06:41 um had a chance to like really focus in
01:06:43 on smaller vineyards within themselves
01:06:45 so
01:06:46 i think with this here this is called
01:06:47 the tri vineyard um
01:06:49 what's the grape on here this is all
01:06:50 sarah syrah okay and when we talk about
01:06:53 when we do fight club we talk about
01:06:55 maybe um
01:06:57 napa does cabs and chard uh really well
01:07:01 many many many things really well but um
01:07:04 you know oregon can crush
01:07:05 um a pinot noir to me and to you
01:07:09 sraw is kind of where washington shines
01:07:11 we can grow
01:07:12 dozens of grapes up here but we kind of
01:07:15 we are we are vying to hang with the
01:07:17 best as it were
01:07:19 christophe beryl maybe one of our
01:07:21 champions in this as we're competing
01:07:23 with the rowan valley
01:07:24 where kind of a lot of straw comes from
01:07:26 in france we can almost
01:07:28 are we there is washington state gonna
01:07:30 are we it's just
01:07:31 different enough no okay that's fair
01:07:33 enough yeah but just different enough
01:07:34 you know what that
01:07:35 that may not be able to compete um
01:07:38 on at what it would be like against like
01:07:40 the northern rhone
01:07:42 you're just saying like i'm different
01:07:43 this is walla walla
01:07:45 and now i'm i'm like like
01:07:48 confident on my own but we've only been
01:07:50 at it for
01:07:51 surah and washington state what 30 years
01:07:54 how long have we been left
01:07:55 less okay so this is not we didn't start
01:07:57 with straw up here right you know it's
01:07:59 been around for you i would say like 30
01:08:00 40 years but i would say the best
01:08:02 ones coming out with probably the early
01:08:04 2000s
01:08:05 okay so look out france because we're
01:08:07 coming for you yeah yeah
01:08:13 but you know i would say i would say the
01:08:14 benefit of winemakers today
01:08:16 think of opus one and think of dominique
01:08:18 lafon before that
01:08:20 and kristoff is the experience that i
01:08:22 think winemakers today
01:08:24 didn't have maybe a generation or two
01:08:26 before us where they can make
01:08:28 vineyard or make wines in northern
01:08:30 hemisphere and southern hemisphere so
01:08:32 they have
01:08:32 more cycles of wine making to go through
01:08:35 year after year
01:08:37 and gain experience yeah right so if we
01:08:40 were here and we were
01:08:41 uh you know in walla walla 40 years ago
01:08:43 we're waiting
01:08:44 one year after the other in order to
01:08:46 learn it's a slow process
01:08:48 to learn the whole process now imagine
01:08:49 if we're doing syrah and then we go to
01:08:51 then australia
01:08:53 in our offseason but during harvest for
01:08:55 the next
01:08:56 season that's coming up you have another
01:08:59 growing cycle and you're learning i
01:09:00 think of it like photography like
01:09:02 imagine if you want to get into
01:09:03 photography
01:09:04 and you can only take four pictures a
01:09:06 year and then you had to wait a year to
01:09:08 see how it developed
01:09:09 right like it literally so if you've
01:09:11 been doing that for hundreds of years
01:09:12 it's a massive advantage if you're just
01:09:14 getting into it it's a it's a bit of a
01:09:15 slow process yeah hey mark
01:09:17 yeah i'm sorry interrupt um where's your
01:09:18 class well we have the drum circle
01:09:20 starting in about 15 minutes
01:09:21 yeah i know you got to get out of there
01:09:22 i got to run upstairs okay you're done
01:09:24 here yeah all right just saying goodbye
01:09:25 okay you also got to manage that
01:09:28 question i got to go light some okay
01:09:29 light the fire and
01:09:30 yeah yeah get it going great yeah there
01:09:32 to help you cool drum circle
01:09:34 all right so and so nelly so in the last
01:09:36 five minutes here brian get someone out
01:09:37 there i think something to ask some
01:09:39 questions because we're gonna have to
01:09:40 like
01:09:40 get to those questions too so okay yeah
01:09:42 well nothing's on
01:09:44 okay live we want to do
01:09:48 in the background all right so um here
01:09:50 we are we're doing washington syrah
01:09:52 yeah what do you smell this it like
01:09:56 makes me want to jump up it's so good
01:09:58 and this is this is my style of syrah
01:10:01 right i get um you know like yeah i get
01:10:03 like sort of like the black
01:10:05 uh black and red fruit combination yeah
01:10:07 which
01:10:08 um which is like cool but it's not about
01:10:12 fruit here
01:10:13 i get smoked meat i get black pepper
01:10:16 i get that sort of like you're like
01:10:18 ready yes yeah it's getting hard
01:10:20 yeah it's salt it's like
01:10:23 bay leaf quality hanging pork in the in
01:10:27 the back room of some sort of like small
01:10:30 village you know marketplace and you're
01:10:32 like yes but you just feel like
01:10:34 you've yeah it's that yeah it's gaming
01:10:37 and it's like those photos you see with
01:10:39 candles and like rabbits hanging with
01:10:41 the first line
01:10:46 all those things bring character to the
01:10:48 wine completely different from what we
01:10:50 started with like or just the last one
01:10:52 where it's
01:10:53 polished really really defined as far as
01:10:57 what fruit looks like
01:10:59 um but does not be a monster no they are
01:11:02 often made in these sort of monstrous
01:11:04 styles you sort of like
01:11:06 massive but it gets to show a lot of
01:11:09 refinement
01:11:10 it gets to show a lot of um elegance
01:11:13 particularly if the wine maker is not
01:11:16 too heavy-handed
01:11:17 um and sort of paying attention to these
01:11:18 things and aiming for that some wine
01:11:20 makers aren't aiming for that
01:11:22 some are but um particularly with age i
01:11:24 think straw gets to just come into
01:11:26 it's like yeah this is the first year
01:11:28 that kristoff made it so this is 2011.
01:11:30 you know now you see that arc of where
01:11:32 syrah can go right when you start to
01:11:34 drink
01:11:34 and this is out of magnum so it ages a
01:11:36 lot a lot slower as well
01:11:39 but once you start to see it climb and
01:11:42 now it's not about fruit but you get all
01:11:44 the secondary notes or the tertiary
01:11:45 notes
01:11:46 that's the drinking period that i want
01:11:48 to be in and i want to capture it the
01:11:50 moment that happens
01:11:51 you know the curiosity of like wanting
01:11:53 to age it or
01:11:54 let it rest for a couple more years um
01:11:57 that's
01:11:57 tempting but now you know uh you you you
01:12:00 like it right now yeah
01:12:02 stick your nose into this i i have a
01:12:03 hunch that people at home are gonna be
01:12:04 like oh
01:12:05 interesting do the here's the thing chop
01:12:07 some meat i think the opus
01:12:09 is easier to fall in love with off the
01:12:11 get-go so i don't know if that's just
01:12:13 because we drink a lot of wine
01:12:14 and geek out and kind of get
01:12:17 tired of this which is a ridiculous
01:12:19 thing to say i don't mean tired of opus
01:12:21 but like
01:12:21 of this but at some point um like this
01:12:24 is
01:12:25 this is easy and approachable and it's
01:12:27 like yes this is a little weird
01:12:29 it just is i think if you let your kids
01:12:32 smile
01:12:32 and ask them which one they think smells
01:12:34 better they're going to say this and
01:12:35 they might even say it smells sweet
01:12:37 right it's not sweet there's zero sugar
01:12:39 in this it's it's bone dry is what we
01:12:41 would say
01:12:42 but that sweetness is fruit your brain
01:12:45 remembers
01:12:46 fruit it remembers ripe fruit like man
01:12:49 sticking your hand in a bowl of
01:12:51 blackberries
01:12:52 right right and in fruit there was a lot
01:12:54 of sweetness so in here
01:12:56 a lot of people might say oh man it's so
01:12:58 swell no it's not sweet actually and
01:13:00 here you don't get sweetness this is a
01:13:01 harder smell i think to get into a
01:13:03 little bit
01:13:03 yeah but man does it pay off when you
01:13:06 when you when you're drinking it like i
01:13:07 just think it's like
01:13:09 ah and kristoff it's really
01:13:13 it is a little dirty right it's it's a
01:13:15 little dirty yeah
01:13:16 it's a little bit uh in a cool way
01:13:19 not in a not in a way that where the
01:13:20 wine was made in any faulty sense
01:13:23 because you can
01:13:24 you can do that if you're not paying
01:13:25 attention to your equipment and whatnot
01:13:26 the wine actually gets dirty
01:13:28 and gets funky in bad ways but this has
01:13:30 like a good funk to it
01:13:32 in the way that that's often cured meats
01:13:35 and those right
01:13:35 you know like when we evaluate wines for
01:13:38 quality
01:13:38 and then start to see if it fits on the
01:13:40 list and we start to see how much we
01:13:42 like it or enjoy it
01:13:43 or what it means like to drink wines
01:13:46 that can express themselves this is an
01:13:48 expressive wine
01:13:50 it's coming out of walla walla so maybe
01:13:52 maybe the idea in itself if we were
01:13:53 picking up any other walla walla
01:13:55 syrah it's not going to taste like this
01:13:57 but this is a winemaker who's got
01:13:59 roots crazy champagne right he's french
01:14:02 so he's going to want to start to do
01:14:03 things a little different
01:14:04 yeah in the vineyard themselves this is
01:14:06 horsepower named after
01:14:08 the horses that go through and plow the
01:14:09 vineyards right he's doing things just a
01:14:11 little different he's caring for the
01:14:13 vineyards a lot differently
01:14:14 organic biodynamic like we talked about
01:14:17 following the rhythms of
01:14:18 of celestial object whether it's the
01:14:20 moon sun stars all of those things play
01:14:22 a factor
01:14:23 in how he's going to prepare the wines
01:14:25 yes um so
01:14:26 understanding different pieces of how
01:14:29 how it affects
01:14:30 the final product is what sort of like a
01:14:32 professional
01:14:33 and somebody passionate is willing to
01:14:36 say like
01:14:36 hey it's not going to be clean like like
01:14:39 um opus one
01:14:40 but i don't want it to be clean i want
01:14:42 it so i think so talk about a little bit
01:14:44 because i think sometimes somebody will
01:14:45 say
01:14:45 well wait a second yeah what's up with
01:14:47 the funkiness or what's up
01:14:49 and isn't it true that the winemaker is
01:14:50 letting that show through right
01:14:52 they're literally saying well hold on a
01:14:53 second this is an agrarian process this
01:14:56 is this is like
01:14:57 um liquid from dirt like let's let
01:15:01 some of the character of the vines and
01:15:03 of the soil and of the land and of
01:15:05 all of that what we would call the
01:15:07 french would call terroir
01:15:08 let's let that show through no one does
01:15:10 that i don't think as well in washington
01:15:12 state
01:15:12 as kristoff correct yeah he he's just
01:15:15 like he just
01:15:15 he's dialed into the dirt a little bit
01:15:17 and it's cool and you see that funkiness
01:15:20 some of his mind's like maybe even like
01:15:23 christopher i love you maybe even too
01:15:25 much for me sometimes i'm like whoa i
01:15:26 lost
01:15:27 i lost the um the specificity of the the
01:15:30 the the
01:15:31 the what's specific about the varietal
01:15:33 for some of the funkiness but that's
01:15:34 that's the beauty of what he does yeah
01:15:36 that's why
01:15:37 it's he has such a cult following
01:15:38 because he's just it tastes amazing yeah
01:15:41 stuff is amazing yeah
01:15:42 and you know i think his approach to
01:15:44 winemaking is something that's been
01:15:46 um looked at and studied in a certain
01:15:48 sense of like respecting
01:15:50 the vineyards and and what's around um
01:15:52 getting the most out of the grape
01:15:54 trying not to interfere with them um
01:15:57 and that is an approach that you would
01:15:58 find a lot of places in the old world
01:16:01 so when you smell taste and evaluate
01:16:03 this wine it automatically it should
01:16:05 draw you to something that's
01:16:07 maybe more reminiscent of something out
01:16:08 of the rhone valley yeah
01:16:10 right and if you can do that and have it
01:16:12 out of washington state
01:16:14 and it be syrah i think that's a huge
01:16:16 one in my book
01:16:17 yeah it makes people like notice us
01:16:21 a little more that yeah in the end when
01:16:24 you when you taste it and you find the
01:16:25 finish you know that it's not
01:16:28 an old world wine usually when i'm going
01:16:31 through and i'm tasting wines and
01:16:33 evaluating them
01:16:34 i have this like last bit of the finish
01:16:36 on and when i'm trying to say like
01:16:38 does it taste and finish fruity
01:16:41 or does it taste uh and finish earthy
01:16:44 right so levels of they're both dry but
01:16:47 maybe in the end it's like
01:16:49 am i getting something funky or i'm
01:16:50 getting something fruity and that
01:16:52 exercise when i do this with this
01:16:53 the chardonnay from lafon finishes like
01:16:57 chalky and minerally when i do it with
01:17:00 burgundy
01:17:01 it's heart taut and a little earthy
01:17:04 when i do it with mouton stinky and
01:17:07 funky but
01:17:09 um on the palette too just like kind of
01:17:10 like like just just
01:17:12 zings you a little bit yeah opus it's
01:17:15 just like
01:17:16 uh a like waterfall of like just like
01:17:19 ripe fruit flavors that just comes
01:17:21 through but it's finishing with fruit
01:17:23 but here we can do a walla walla or do
01:17:25 it with syrah and horsepower
01:17:27 i get everything that reminds me of an
01:17:28 old world wine the aromatics on the nose
01:17:30 they remind me of
01:17:32 what you'd find in the northern rhone
01:17:33 valley what's graphite or
01:17:36 guitar and then when i finally put it on
01:17:38 the palette and i finish up
01:17:39 the last thing i get is starting to draw
01:17:42 to that black plum
01:17:44 that concentrated fruit quality right on
01:17:45 the palate
01:17:47 it's good it brings me back to a new
01:17:48 world why so here's the thing
01:17:50 we're out of time here's what we want
01:17:52 you to do
01:17:54 we want you to enjoy these for the rest
01:17:55 of the evening they're wines
01:17:57 chosen such that maybe people were not
01:17:59 on the chat anymore so maybe you're out
01:18:01 but here's
01:18:02 you got all weekend and these wines will
01:18:05 go the distance throughout the course of
01:18:06 the evening
01:18:07 uh our it was our hope and our expressed
01:18:10 intent
01:18:11 that this would be a night to kick off
01:18:13 the weekend
01:18:14 um to celebrate to uh to maybe just to
01:18:18 let go of some of the stuff that we've
01:18:20 been all holding on to and
01:18:22 to raise a glass hopefully you're able
01:18:24 to be with a loved one if not
01:18:25 you pick up your telephone you dial a
01:18:27 number and you call them and you say hey
01:18:29 i'm having a great glass of wine right
01:18:30 now and i'm thinking of you that's not
01:18:32 drunk dialing by the way
01:18:33 unless you're done with the wine already
01:18:35 and maybe maybe that's a different story
01:18:36 but like
01:18:37 i would just say that's what the night
01:18:38 is for and these wines you're gonna have
01:18:40 fun with them for the next hour or two
01:18:42 easy watch how they develop see what
01:18:44 happens and just
01:18:46 uh and just enjoy it it's been i don't
