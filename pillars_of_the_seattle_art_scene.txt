06:26: totally cool actually later all right
06:29: excellent
06:29: um so we got a chance to talk yesterday
06:32: through some of this but i just want to
06:33: for those that are kind of tuning in for
06:35: the first time
06:36: a little bit the premise of this was
06:38: that you know we have no business and
06:40: you you know
06:41: my i know absolutely or next to nothing
06:45: about art and yet when we thought you
06:47: know how do we what do we do around here
06:49: to kind of keep the lights on in the
06:50: city and maybe
06:51: uh put out an encouraging word we
06:53: thought what a great opportunity to head
06:55: back to school and
06:57: um to to take a moment to slow down and
06:59: to pause
07:00: and just to study our own town and
07:03: as i've been reflecting through these
07:05: classes i am falling in love with the
07:07: city that i thought i knew really well
07:09: and as it turns out i i really don't and
07:12: so it's been amazing
07:13: even though i wouldn't wish a pandemic
07:15: on anyone it's been amazing
07:16: even just to have the space to kind of
07:19: take a moment
07:20: and say who are the people who who kind
07:23: of built the city and made it what it is
07:25: and maybe they've already been
07:26: through hardships like we're going
07:27: through and what are the character
07:29: traits that we could learn from them
07:30: and you um have brought two of them to
07:33: the forefront and introduced me to two
07:35: of them i have been
07:36: loving researching them online oh my
07:39: gosh
07:39: um jenny wright and barbara earl thomas
07:42: barbara's website is stunningly
07:43: beautiful
07:44: go there and just stare at it and and um
07:47: and encourage yourself but before we go
07:50: there before we kind of
07:51: head to that direction can we just get a
07:53: couple of things straight about what it
07:55: means to be a curator
07:58: of modern and contemporary art can you
08:01: take us into the into into your world a
08:03: little bit what do you
08:04: what do you do for a living oh i love
08:07: that question
08:08: yes actually you are in my world because
08:10: you're in my office which is always
08:12: when i'm not around yard i'm around
08:14: books and papers so everything is always
08:16: overflowing with materials here they
08:18: seem to
08:19: was i was wondering if one of the things
08:20: in the background is like the next cool
08:22: exhibit is this a sneak peek
08:24: at some great piece of art there
08:27: may maybe maybe i mean there's always i
08:30: i can't turn around my pc but in front
08:32: of me is like
08:33: the wall of inspiration all the
08:35: different things i think about
08:36: all the time um behind me is a poster
08:39: from a show we did a couple of years ago
08:41: but yes it's always a mix of a mix of
08:44: different things
08:45: but in terms of what does the curator do
08:49: um i mean you study you study art you
08:52: study art history uh
08:54: and they're for those who are like
08:57: totally new to this whole thing
08:58: they're two types of well maybe three
09:02: types of curators i mean there are the
09:04: the curators who only organized
09:06: biennales you know if you ever heard of
09:08: like the venice biennale these kind of
09:09: big art shows
09:11: those are like big events right where
09:15: a curator or curatorial team get
09:17: together
09:19: and think about what is big new
09:22: important in the world right now if you
09:25: work at a
09:26: institution if you work as a curator at
09:28: a museum that is collecting art
09:31: you know your role is much more um
09:35: i think a lot of people think of
09:36: curators only through exhibitions
09:39: so that's one of the things um that we
09:41: do it's a really
09:42: fun part but these days you know you
09:44: hear about people curating coffee bean
09:46: collections and wines i'm sure as you're
09:49: aware
09:50: um but curator means somebody who takes
09:52: care of art
09:53: in the original definition and
09:57: in terms of working at a museum you both
10:00: look at
10:01: well what is what is important right now
10:03: what are the kind of
10:04: shows you want to do that becomes a
10:06: conversation with
10:07: many colleagues around the museum and
10:11: at the same time you of course also look
10:14: at building the collection so the fun
10:16: part
10:17: which is something we might go less into
10:19: this evening but maybe for another day
10:22: is thinking about well what are really
10:24: important things that we should be
10:26: collecting
10:27: and how should we building our
10:29: collection so those are kind of two
10:32: um and that's that's sort of what i
10:33: think that's kind of what i think about
10:36: when i think about what you're doing and
10:37: i know people always assume that i just
10:40: sit around and taste food and wine and
10:42: that's the restaurant business and i
10:44: and i imagine that you just sit around
10:46: you know staring at beautiful art
10:48: at the sort of the ultimate arbiter of
10:51: what is cool in the art world it's just
10:52: sort of like yes
10:53: no yes no but but maybe that's not how
10:57: it happens that you don't
10:58: just like scroll in front of you you
11:00: know um but
11:01: but you do get to do this in some sense
11:04: like like you are
11:05: kind of living the dream gig of the
11:07: person who
11:09: is helping to define
11:12: not just um northwest art in the sense
11:15: of what we
11:16: are are collecting and and safeguarding
11:19: here
11:19: you know in the seattle art museum and
11:21: the sculpture part the other ones but
11:23: like
11:23: you're you're also working with the
11:25: artists to sort of help
11:27: like help bring this art to life right
11:29: and as we were talking
11:30: the museum has this really cool mission
11:32: statement
11:33: can you talk about that a little bit
11:34: like for those that may not
11:36: like myself may just be like complete
11:38: cretans like the laymen of art like what
11:41: is the point
11:42: of the museum and and and why is it it
11:44: crushes it
11:46: and do they restore art people are
11:47: curious oh and some people are even
11:49: asking on the chat my
11:50: my brother brian is monitoring the chat
11:52: right now and do you restore
11:54: art is that a part of it like are you in
11:56: that
11:57: they don't let me anywhere near touching
11:59: the art that's not what a curator is
12:00: allowed to do
12:01: that's what a conservator does they have
12:04: you know
12:05: incredibly specialized training they get
12:07: to learn how to
12:09: mix oils and i mean huge specialization
12:13: i mean one person deals only with
12:15: objects for instance destroying them
12:17: somebody else only the painting somebody
12:19: else only even
12:20: works on paper so i wish i had that
12:23: skill set but
12:24: um unfortunately no they don't even want
12:27: me to hang anything on the wall because
12:29: it would probably be falling off if i
12:31: did it so no i'm not handling the art
12:33: okay but but you but you do get to sort
12:36: of
12:36: look at it and say okay this is for us
12:39: like this is for the seattle art museum
12:41: or that maybe not so much right is that
12:43: a that's an important piece of what
12:45: you're
12:46: and how does that work yeah i mean it's
12:47: kind of it kind of cuts to
12:49: um you know starts to go in the
12:51: direction here
12:52: uh of the talk this evening so as a
12:55: curator of contemporary art
12:57: um who works at a general museum such as
13:00: the field art museum and the museum's
13:01: mission is connecting art to life
13:04: so um you know the museum started with a
13:07: big collection of
13:08: asian art in what is today the seattle
13:10: asian art museum
13:11: up on capitol hill um then we have the
13:15: big building downtown that's where i'm
13:17: sitting right now
13:18: and the museum also has the olympic
13:20: sculpture park which is
13:23: a 15-minute walk from here on the on the
13:25: waterfront so all three sites
13:27: are the clark museum but it's it's kind
13:30: of helpful to remember
13:31: that the museum started out in 1933 as a
13:35: museum of asian art and all these other
13:38: departments and collections
13:40: subsequently were added onto
13:43: um that optional focus
13:46: and i'm just going back one more time to
13:48: this idea of you know curating
13:50: contemporary art so one of the things
13:52: that i love about being a curator of
13:54: contemporary art let's see compared to
13:57: um somebody with a specialization in
14:00: renaissance art or in african art of
14:02: earlier periods
14:04: i get to work with living artists i get
14:06: to have conversations with
14:08: artists i get to sometimes as in the
14:11: case with barbara all thomas
14:14: i get to see the work as it's being made
14:18: right so visiting in the studio
14:21: seeing how things take shape and that's
14:24: different
14:25: than say saying gosh i dreamt up this
14:28: fantastic exhibition
14:30: here are the works that i want to borrow
14:32: but they're all
14:33: already completed and so
14:36: you know what you're inviting into your
14:39: exhibition it's a it's unknown
14:41: so to speak but working with
14:43: contemporary artists
14:44: is a huge amount of fun and of course
14:47: there are
14:48: surprises too are you kind of i mean are
14:50: you kind of freaking out a little bit i
14:51: mean it seems like when you're
14:53: winning like an art creator you guys are
14:55: so put together and the museum is so
14:57: professionally and beautiful and
14:59: but like when you finally get to work
15:01: with an artist
15:02: and and you're there either
15:04: collaborating or talk
15:05: there's got to be a little sort of like
15:08: fandom that goes on like oh my gosh it's
15:10: you like do you or is that like not cool
15:12: in the artist community you're like oh
15:13: it's nice to meet you oh it's nice to
15:15: meet you or did you just get to be like
15:16: okay let's have a small freak out i
15:17: can't believe i'm standing in front of
15:18: this piece or i'm actually talking to
15:20: you in person
15:20: like who do you sort of you know fan
15:23: girl over when it comes to
15:24: like have you ever just kind of gotten a
15:26: little bit beside yourself or is that
15:28: not
15:28: is that like it's interesting you're
15:31: just so much
15:32: in it i mean of course you know it's an
15:34: honor to be working with all these
15:36: different people but i'm sure
15:38: just like yourself if you get to you
15:40: know you might admire
15:42: um so many different cuisines you know
15:45: so many different chefs
15:46: um you know you go to other restaurants
15:49: and so of course you have lots and lots
15:51: of different personalities and some
15:53: people are very
15:54: outgoing also in a collaboration um
15:58: other people have very sad ideas i mean
16:00: it's a universe i mean it's the entire
16:03: world
16:03: um you know in terms of people and
16:07: outlooks and
16:08: aesthetics each i mean each experience
16:10: is completely unique and different
16:13: i think you're more professional than i
16:14: am i like me so i'm like i can't believe
16:16: i'm meeting you this is like super
16:18: exciting
16:19: um okay so talk a little bit about the
16:20: projects you're working on you have two
16:21: going on
16:22: um one is launching this week or soon is
16:26: it friday or
16:27: or when uh does jenny's stuff go up

16:42: once um
16:43: because of kobit please make sure you
16:45: get your tickets online
16:46: you need to have like a reserved time um
16:49: because you want to make sure it doesn't
16:51: get crowded
16:52: and and things like that so the show
16:54: that's about to open
16:56: is called city of tomorrow
16:59: jenny wright and the art that shaped a
17:02: new seattle
17:03: and um you know just like you when
17:06: you know the pandemic hit and suddenly
17:10: were all at home
17:12: we've been more introspective in
17:15: thinking about
17:16: the city and our community and on top of
17:20: all that
17:20: um just before the pandemic hit ginny
17:24: wright or
17:24: virginia is actually her official name
17:26: but everybody really knows where it's
17:28: ginny
17:29: um ginny i like ginny too
17:33: jenny passed away in february she was
17:37: truly a pillar of um kind of
17:40: forging a whole community around
17:43: contemporary art here in seattle she was
17:46: in her early 90s when she passed away
17:48: and we thought
17:49: all right here we are this is the moment
17:52: let's kind of let's take stock of the
17:55: incredible legacy
17:56: that she's left us right and so the
17:58: exhibition
18:01: is a mixture of the incredible
18:03: collection
18:05: she put together i mean she was a
18:07: collector
18:08: she was a long time sam docent
18:11: a board member of over 60 years and
18:13: trust me
18:14: but she started really really cool
18:17: things here in the city
18:19: um including a contemporary art group
18:21: long before our museum had
18:23: a modern and contemporary art department
18:26: um
18:26: so yeah she's done so she has this like
18:29: this
18:30: uh very wide you know far afield sort of
18:33: influence on the seattle art scene can
18:36: you start us kind of walk us through
18:38: a general timeline of because she really
18:41: is kind of
18:42: her name pops up everywhere as we start
18:45: to understand our own
18:46: art history here in the city walk us
18:48: through sort of that
18:50: i'm i'm going to start with a picture
18:51: because you want to know who you are i
18:53: love this yes yeah show us what you got
18:54: all right so oh
18:55: okay so let me see i want to make sure i
18:58: hope everybody can
19:00: see that absolutely oh she's beautiful
19:03: look at her this is ginger this is ginny
19:05: right
19:06: maybe mid 1960s so for the people who
19:10: don't know her never heard of her ginny
19:14: is the daughter of the blodels maybe
19:18: some of you have been
19:19: chewbainbridge island is the bluedell
19:21: reserve that was her parents
19:23: they uh they moved there her mother
19:25: loved gardening and so that her parents
19:27: later on established the bodel reserve
19:30: and um she grew up in vancouver and
19:34: spent kind of summers
19:35: around seattle when she was really young
19:37: and then she studied in new york at
19:39: barnard college she studied art history
19:41: got her bachelor's there
19:44: and through a very inspirational teacher
19:48: she was introduced to contemporary art
19:50: and we have to remember new york
19:52: at that time it was like all starting to
19:55: happen
19:56: this was where you know big ideas
19:59: in in art were starting to galvanize
20:02: during and right after world war ii
20:04: and so she would have been there in the
20:06: late 40s early 50s
20:08: just that all of that was taking off and
20:11: um so that was just the very beginning
20:15: and then she moved back to seattle with
20:16: her husband bagley
20:18: who um helped with the financing of the
20:22: space needle the seattle icon for the
20:24: seattle world space i have another
20:26: tower across the street there yeah look
20:27: at this oh i love it
20:30: so city of tomorrow sorry i hope people
20:32: can read that it was a poster
20:35: slash special edition for the seattle
20:38: times
20:39: the 62 we're talking 62
20:42: okay in the middle sorry about the
20:44: reverse this is the kind of part uh in
20:46: terms of the reading but
20:48: since we're doing this paper and we're
20:49: fun in the middle is ginny at the launch
20:52: or
20:52: introduction of the space needle in 1961
20:56: all dressed to the nines and all of that
20:58: and then a couple of
20:59: it was a very future focused player so
21:01: check out that car
21:03: at the bottom
21:06: that monorail that was built so live
21:08: magazine
21:09: was all over it and uh jfk
21:12: opened it by a telephone um with like
21:15: a speech i mean it was a moment
21:19: as i got to understand uh because
21:22: obviously i'm new to town
21:24: but 1962 in the world's fair from
21:27: everybody i spoke to and what i've read
21:30: was a turning point in the city because
21:33: suddenly people were thinking about what
21:35: might be
21:36: possible um a different kind of future
21:39: and of course it was the beginning of
21:41: the
21:42: space exploration was just around the
21:44: corner
21:45: and um if you if you go back to the fair
21:49: and some of those documentations i love
21:51: how
21:52: the region was already sustainable well
21:54: ahead of its time they
21:56: they advertise hydropower
21:59: [Music]
22:00: and various other
22:03: future visions of of what technology
22:05: might do in the future
22:07: there was a very very cool show and it
22:10: also showcased
22:11: contemporary art some of which were the
22:14: artists who
22:15: ginny wright had gotten to know in new
22:17: york city
22:18: in in the early 1950s when she worked at
22:21: an art gallery there
22:23: and that gave her the idea of gosh
22:26: wouldn't it be great to have more great
22:29: shows
22:30: especially of contemporary art for which
22:32: there wasn't much of an outlet
22:34: uh in seattle um apart of course from
22:37: the important indigenous art that was
22:40: well established
22:41: well-known well-loved here in the region
22:44: and
22:45: you know the the kind of artists who had
22:48: made a
22:48: name earlier in seattle and what are
22:52: mark toby if that's the name that's
22:53: familiar to
22:55: anyone um and kind of people from that
22:57: generation
22:58: but she wanted to bring what was
23:01: considered to be so cool and
23:03: cool and hip in new york city and all of
23:05: those new ideas and development
23:08: yeah well ahead of well ahead of our
23:12: time in that
23:13: sense i mean in so many ways um
23:17: you know i even remember when dad always
23:21: tells brian and i the story that when
23:22: the space dinner
23:23: was being built um and they first said
23:26: there's gonna be a restaurant on top of
23:27: this i mean they built the thing like in
23:28: a year so we tour it tomorrow actually
23:30: it's a field trip and so
23:31: we're gonna we're gonna be up there but
23:33: um that our grandfather
23:35: gave this big speech in the restaurant
23:37: that just said look
23:38: this is the future of dining and
23:41: and we've got a sh we've got to shape up
23:43: like we have to like rise to the
23:45: occasion because
23:46: once this thing is built you know it's
23:49: either it's
23:50: it's it's either their way the highway
23:51: like we would like we were gonna have
23:52: this competition and it sort of
23:53: galvanized the team to say we we've got
23:55: to push the restaurant forward and
23:57: i think the world's fair and the space
24:00: needle and all of that
24:01: you know kind of kicks seattle into gear
24:04: in a certain
24:05: in all these little ways and though i
24:07: didn't realize it was also part of the
24:08: hard thing
24:09: yeah i i love to hear about that that's
24:12: really really interesting
24:14: um and of course it's like it was the
24:16: first
24:18: restaurant on top of a tower that had
24:20: like this rotating
24:21: yes uh mechanism so you could sit down
24:24: and if you didn't get dizzy you could
24:26: actually see the whole city and and
24:28: panorama from up there
24:31: we'd love that but then you know for
24:32: half of dinner you'd be staring at
24:33: highway 99.
24:35: so we just went with the fixed do you
24:36: know you mentioned mark toby and um
24:39: it reminds me of a story so i'm sitting
24:41: upstairs you know in the in this
24:42: in this private dining room we have and
24:44: and the walls over here they used to be
24:46: nearer but
24:47: um about the same time frame as as the
24:50: story you're telling
24:50: mark toby actually came and offered to
24:53: peter
24:54: he said look i'll paint you a mural on
24:56: this wall
24:58: for if i could just have dinner for life
25:00: if we just will just make an arrangement
25:02: where i'll just paint this wall
25:04: and then like for the rest of my life
25:05: you know i won't have to i don't have to
25:07: pay here
25:08: and very foolishly peter said no
25:11: and and you know and so we're all sort
25:13: of like after the fact
25:15: kicking ourselves because clearly that
25:17: would have been
25:19: um way more valuable than obviously the
25:21: price of dinner but um
25:22: but we have been following what a great
25:24: story yeah but
25:26: but you know you can hindsight is 20 20.
25:28: but um
25:29: when we're looking at jenny right and
25:31: and we're saying you know
25:32: the influence and impact that she's had
25:35: um
25:35: on this city what about specifically for
25:38: that you had to go through
25:40: and and pull like a few pieces like
25:43: of this whole body of of work and stuff
25:47: how did you do that and and and like how
25:50: did you choose you essentially you're
25:51: telling her story
25:53: through this through this exhibition how
25:56: do you
25:57: take the the grand volume of body of
26:00: work and significance and pare it down
26:02: into a
26:02: what was that process like yeah it's
26:05: really really hard
26:06: uh quite frankly i mean you know ginny
26:09: and her husband
26:10: get vaguely over their lifetime gave
26:13: over 200
26:14: major major artworks uh to the seattle
26:16: art museum alone and i should also say
26:19: that there's they were so civic-minded
26:22: um
26:23: in in helping to foster other uh
26:26: institutions around seattle like the
26:28: repertory theater was a big
26:30: um project
26:33: for uh her husband for instance but also
26:36: the henry art gallery
26:37: the university it's not just um limited
26:40: to our museum and
26:42: telling that larger story and imagining
26:44: what the future looks like
26:46: was kind of part of that project but you
26:48: know just to give you a little flavor
26:50: of the variety of art she collected so
26:54: what i tried to do in my selection
26:55: is give people almost gallery by gallery
26:59: and introduction
27:00: to different kinds of archie collected
27:03: so
27:04: back in the day in in new york city when
27:07: all of that abstract
27:08: painting you know was like the
27:11: thing that everybody was looking at let
27:14: me see if you can see that a little
27:15: better if i double this up
27:17: yeah no i can see it you know like like
27:19: these really dramatic
27:21: paintings um and then much more lyrical
27:23: ones over here
27:25: de kooning was one of the big heroes and
27:27: the cool things of her was
27:29: she collected all of these artists for
27:32: the most part right out of their first
27:35: shows
27:35: you know she saw the work she bought it
27:37: a lot of people
27:38: um i mean that takes a lot of guts right
27:41: she had that
27:42: instinct she knew like that is quality
27:45: work
27:46: and brought it into her own her own
27:48: collection
27:49: and then from that donates all these
27:51: pieces to the museum
27:53: yeah so i mean she um she often said
27:56: i mean she she um there there are a
27:59: couple of others you know but also
28:01: sculptures
28:02: yeah and i mean she kind of keeps
28:05: growing
28:06: bit by bit and it's just really hard to
28:08: convey
28:09: um the scale of some of those things uh
28:12: in a single exhibition they're trying to
28:14: tell that bigger um picture
28:17: so you know going from like abstract
28:19: paintings to large
28:21: installations and sculptures i have
28:23: another
28:24: fun picture here if anyone's ever been
28:26: up to western washington
28:29: oh sorry before we go there okay so very
28:33: you just saw this kind of gorgeous
28:35: gestural painting right
28:37: now look at that really cool very um
28:41: austere almost this is kind of just
28:43: minimal all right
28:44: um it's the gray you hold that one up
28:47: again with a piece of paper behind it
28:49: you're
28:49: you're saying the is the painting on the
28:50: wall or the sculpture on the left
28:53: okay there's something ready in the
28:57: moment
28:58: yeah yeah exactly this artist just had a
29:01: huge retrospective at the museum of
29:03: modern art in europe donald trump
29:06: and uh and this is a california artist
29:09: really hard to see
29:10: especially i'm laughing i'm showing you
29:13: talk about the copy of the copy of a
29:15: copy you have this
29:17: gorgeous painting which you must come
29:19: and see in person
29:20: yeah um cool thing about that particular
29:24: work is
29:25: they all work with light as a material
29:27: so they create surfaces that are
29:28: reflective
29:30: they um like that
29:33: little white painting that i was trying
29:35: to show you
29:36: if you're in the gallery and you walk
29:38: past it it slashes
29:40: because she puts glass particles in the
29:42: middle of it you know like in the
29:44: in the road yeah when you have like
29:45: reflectors it's kind of the same
29:49: suddenly lights up a strip so completely
29:52: different aesthetic
29:53: and then if you go up to western
29:57: washington university
29:59: she her father in 1969
30:02: established a fund for her that
30:06: would be the purpose of acquiring work
30:09: for public spaces
30:10: so a lot of amazing sculptures you see
30:12: around seattle not just at our olympic
30:14: sculpture park but in seattle center
30:17: the big hammering man in front of our
30:19: building
30:20: all of these are things that jeannie
30:21: helped commission and if you go up to
30:23: western washington university
30:26: she and a group of her advisors created
30:29: this big
30:30: um sculpture park and um
30:33: you know all of these different they're
30:35: very large in scale but it's really fun
30:37: especially
30:38: now in the fall to go up there pretty
30:40: safe for covet it's all outdoors
30:42: it's all free it's a wonderful trip
30:47: with the can you see that do you have
30:49: like the wrench here
30:50: this is the artist there's these huge
30:54: enormous um uh installations
30:58: and there she is kind of holding that
31:00: big wrench for him as he's
31:01: tightening up the screws so katarina
31:04: where where does she get
31:06: i mean so maybe i'm just gonna sort of
31:08: like display my
31:09: ignorance and and wide open view what
31:12: how does
31:12: okay take take the sculpture take
31:16: um the column of sort of this austere
31:20: very symmetrical column of cubes or
31:23: whatnot
31:24: take a white painting that's white on
31:26: white on white with a little
31:27: reflectivity
31:28: how does ginny how do you
31:32: look through you know uh dozens and
31:35: dozens of those
31:36: and say um that is special
31:40: this one not so much like what
31:43: what is it that the two of you in a
31:47: certain sense i i kind of feel like
31:49: um you know you get to be so intimate
31:52: with her work and the
31:53: and the life of of sort of like
31:56: how does that happen you know what what
31:59: is it
31:59: that that she sees and what is it that
32:02: that you see in the work that she sees
32:04: does that make sense like
32:05: i kind of see you like standing on these
32:07: shoulders of this incredible woman
32:08: and and now we get to come in and
32:10: experience it
32:12: a microcosm of it but can you walk us
32:14: through
32:15: the curator's eye of what distinguishes
32:18: um just another um stark painting on the
32:21: wall to something truly special
32:23: yeah i i'd love thank you so much for
32:25: that question it's a really good one
32:28: i mean you know what comes before
32:32: um acquiring a work or deciding this is
32:36: important or
32:37: you know this is something that
32:40: you know a lot of people have done
32:42: before comes
32:45: i mean a lot of reading a lot of
32:47: studying and a lot of looking the more
32:49: you
32:50: see things um and you can kind of
32:52: evaluate it against the
32:55: larger art history the more you can
32:58: understand why somebody's really taking
33:00: an incredible risk here's somebody who's
33:02: really trying to push the boundaries of
33:06: what's
33:06: possible here is somebody who's doing
33:09: something
33:10: that hasn't been done before or is
33:12: asking new
33:13: questions and that's really at the heart
33:16: of territorial work because what you do
33:19: in a museum is
33:21: you essentially explore different
33:23: stories and when you
33:25: you know lay out an exhibition and you
33:27: decide every single relationship between
33:29: this painting and that sculpture and
33:31: something else
33:32: you're trying to draw the visual
33:36: narrative
33:37: and some of the things that maybe not
33:39: everybody does but i certainly do is
33:43: you might have three different entrances
33:45: into a single space
33:46: or you might see things one way going in
33:49: in a different way going out
33:51: and if uh if you um
33:54: if you can kind of build on that
33:56: spatially
33:58: you can you can build complexity within
34:01: a larger you know theme that you're
34:03: already exploring
34:04: so your part of your role
34:08: if i'm hearing you right is okay so the
34:11: art
34:11: the the piece has been produced and and
34:14: you're putting yourselves in the in my
34:17: shoes saying look
34:18: this is how you're gonna walk through
34:19: the space this is how you're gonna enter
34:21: the museum this is how you can enter the
34:22: room
34:23: this is how you can exit the room that's
34:25: to say the thing is on the wall
34:26: or it's sitting in the center of this
34:28: volume of space
34:30: and you're thinking through the way i'm
34:32: gonna experience that and
34:34: kind of building the show that way
34:37: i mean in a certain sense it makes me
34:38: think of building a dish i
34:40: you know i don't make dishes um brady
34:43: williams the chef does the dishes and
34:45: yet
34:46: you know those fun moments where he
34:47: comes forth and he's like hey i have
34:49: this
34:50: this new idea and i've plated it up and
34:52: you know will you you know can you eat
34:54: it will you try it and it's
34:55: i always think of my role obviously it's
34:58: going to be delicious right and so
34:59: that's never
35:00: so much the thing as it is thinking
35:02: through how will a hundred guests
35:04: perceive this dish
35:06: which which orientation will they will
35:08: they spin it will they pick up a fork or
35:10: will they
35:11: pick up a spoon like what is the um what
35:14: is the interaction
35:15: that the person has with the beautiful
35:17: thing that's been created
35:18: and how can we make that um
35:22: you know 99 times out of 100 100 a real
35:26: um special thing how can i connect the
35:28: guests and you said the mission of the
35:30: art museum is to connect art to life and
35:32: i'm thinking
35:33: how do i connect the guest to this dish
35:35: in such a way and sometimes
35:37: it takes some massaging it takes some
35:39: curation maybe
35:40: and i love yeah i love the uh of you
35:43: walking through this space and sort of
35:45: saying well maybe this maybe not this
35:47: here maybe that here or maybe after
35:49: they've seen this one
35:51: then they need to go see this one and
35:53: there's this sort of journey
35:55: you know the way you could also think
35:57: about it is um
36:00: you know you can either have an open
36:02: menu and everybody chooses whatever they
36:04: like
36:05: or you and the chef plan a menu right so
36:08: they have your appetizer
36:10: you have your main dish you have your
36:12: dessert
36:13: because you know how these different
36:15: flavors
36:16: are going to build one on to the other
36:20: and you know a curator takes you step by
36:22: step from one gallery
36:24: into another and so um that
36:27: too there is um the order isn't random
36:31: but is uh it's deliberate so then of
36:33: course we have choices of
36:35: taking a left turn and a right turn and
36:37: deciding you know
36:38: where you want to put your ass yes yes
36:42: and there and there are so many
36:43: restaurants that don't give you that
36:44: choice like this is exactly the way once
36:46: you experience it which is super cool
36:47: and there are others that kind of sit
36:49: back and say
36:50: i'm gonna put you in the driver's seat
36:51: and hey take um tell me about barbara
36:54: earl thomas
36:54: so here you are in oh well before we go
36:58: there
36:58: yeah out of all of jenny's work what was
37:01: she
37:02: most excited to see in person did you
37:04: hear that question
37:06: yeah i did hear that question god so
37:10: the best way i can answer that is she
37:12: always believed
37:13: in each artist to kind of define the
37:16: question
37:17: anew um i
37:21: don't know about um all of her favorites
37:24: and
37:24: gosh i didn't print this out but she had
37:27: a couple of
37:28: pieces to which she returned over and
37:30: over again
37:31: one was um a beautiful mark roscoe
37:35: painting okay you gotta all come and see
37:37: the show
37:37: there's like no other way to do this
37:39: beautiful
37:40: color fields that are like clouds moving
37:43: right in front of you
37:45: it's like and there's a fantastic story
37:48: around it because
37:49: she was really attached to it um because
37:52: it was
37:53: one of the first truly major
37:56: acquisitions she made she was barely out
37:58: of school she had just started working
38:00: at this art gallery in manhattan in new
38:02: york
38:03: and um the gallery next door which
38:06: showed
38:07: super cutting-edge artists had this had
38:09: the show
38:10: and a friend ran over and told her you
38:12: really got to see this painting it's
38:14: like fire and ice
38:15: and she went to see it and she loved it
38:18: but she thought it was huge
38:19: i mean by today today's standards it's
38:21: maybe the size of a door
38:23: um that you know we've become accustomed
38:26: to work that is much bigger than that
38:28: but back in the day that was a huge
38:31: painting
38:32: and so she she wants to negotiate to pay
38:34: the painting kind of
38:36: um over a period of time kind of
38:39: installments which was possible back
38:41: then
38:42: but the story was that the dealer was a
38:45: little gave her the cool shoulder
38:47: because she was a total unknown
38:49: and said you know he just doesn't sell
38:51: to just anyone
38:52: this is at a time when they they
38:53: couldn't even sell any of these artists
38:56: work but talk about a little bit of
38:57: attitude right
38:58: right so she said you gotta go and see
39:01: the artist
39:01: he has to interview you and if he
39:03: approves then i can sell you that
39:05: painting
39:06: yup so they hit it all they hit it off
39:09: and the artist had two stipulations he
39:12: said
39:13: okay number one you've got to hang it
39:15: right now in your apartment
39:17: and that was one thing where she was a
39:18: little worried about she said this is
39:20: really large i don't know if it's going
39:21: to fit and he said
39:23: never mind if it's in any space it's
39:25: going to be just fine
39:27: and and she later on agreed she said it
39:29: was phenomenal it was like an
39:30: environment that you would walk into
39:33: and second stipulation which you thought
39:35: was hilarious
39:36: was that he said you're not allowed to
39:38: lend it to
39:39: any museum for a full year
39:43: at that point in time nobody was buying
39:45: the art at that point in time you know
39:47: moma and the whitney and all of those
39:50: big museums in new york or else we had
39:52: no interest
39:54: or um you know we're maybe just starting
39:57: to look at some of these artists
39:59: so she was like that's hilarious very
40:01: easy i can keep that promise and
40:04: kind of that that was a very important
40:08: moment for her because it was very
40:10: ambitious and that same
40:12: ambition and drive then determined where
40:14: she wanted to go
40:15: and so she had a huge library she kept
40:17: reading
40:18: but in answer to the question i i think
40:20: the rothbard was probably one of her
40:22: favorites
40:23: before we move on to barbara oh
40:26: yeah okay if i can cheat
40:29: can i can i actually
40:32: i could oh i if you let me cheat i share
40:35: my screen for one second sure oh but you
40:37: have to give me permission and then i
40:39: can show you the painting
40:40: okay all right i think we can trust her
40:43: at this point is that going to work
40:44: from a production stand can she share
40:45: her screen is that
40:48: we're not you know we're not zoom
40:49: experts around here but we're learning
40:52: we're getting the hang of it let me ask
40:53: you a question while they're figuring
40:54: that out
40:55: um yep because you've gotten to know her
40:58: so well
40:59: what um personally is there a character
41:02: trait
41:03: of jenny wright that you just would love
41:06: to um to embody or to like something
41:10: that you admire
41:11: about her that that you know you wish
41:13: you had that
41:14: in you that spirit that sort of what is
41:16: the thing most
41:17: as a that yeah
41:21: there's so many things that are
41:22: inspiring but i think for me
41:24: especially as a curator i mean i'm
41:26: trained to look at art right i mean i
41:28: can spend the whole day looking at art
41:30: and i'm not going to get
41:31: tired or bored or anything but if you
41:34: think about it
41:35: i mean take your taste in music right
41:39: when you grow up
41:40: you know maybe it's your teenage years
41:42: or when you're you know a young adult
41:45: that music will probably stay with you
41:48: and will
41:48: have like a deep connection with you are
41:51: you gonna
41:52: keep up with all the music trends that
41:54: continue going forward
41:57: ginny when it came to art had this
42:00: amazing curiosity that kept
42:02: her open-minded not professionally but
42:04: just out of a personal drive
42:07: and so to challenge yourself all the
42:09: time and say well it's a little out of
42:11: my comfort zone but i'm gonna
42:13: look and really consider at that and um
42:16: so would we talk about
42:17: modern and contemporary what jenny was
42:20: able to do over her
42:21: lifetime right out of school out into
42:24: new york to later in her life
42:26: i mean i always wrestle with those words
42:28: and try to understand the difference
42:28: between but like
42:30: speaking um you know belonging to the
42:32: present is
42:33: like you know what we think about for
42:35: contemporary and up to date for modern
42:38: so you're saying
42:39: throughout her lifetime she didn't just
42:41: keep listening to the album that she
42:42: loved
42:43: in you know in her 20s she kept taking
42:46: risks
42:47: and staying with the time and so her
42:49: collection
42:50: has been a role a scrolling snapshot of
42:54: what
42:55: 30 40 50 years of modern contemporary
42:58: art which
42:58: which really kind of sets her in many
43:01: ways
43:02: apart from so many so many other
43:04: collectors and so many of her peers
43:05: perhaps is because she took
43:07: she was a risk taker and she knew yeah
43:09: she saw beauty and she
43:10: and she knew and she and she went after
43:12: it which is yeah but
43:13: she i think you you really nailed it
43:17: that's exactly
43:18: those are my notes from you yesterday
43:21: so i didn't make that up okay hold on
43:25: barbara i want to get to her because i
43:27: think she's so cool barbara earl thomas
43:29: here you are you are currently working
43:31: with her um
43:32: she is um she's crush this woman is
43:35: um she's a she's a writer she is a
43:38: speaker
43:39: she's a lecturer about art she's an
43:41: artist herself she is a teacher
43:43: uh she is a commentator i think on
43:46: society
43:47: and through her art and through her
43:48: words and
43:50: um i don't know i see her as this sort
43:52: of like fearless woman who is just
43:54: um tell me about her tell me what it's
43:57: like to work with her tell me about the
43:59: exhibit that you
44:01: are putting together um this is a this
44:03: is this is
44:04: this is one of our our own hometown
44:07: heroes who i think we can be so proud in
44:09: but
44:09: but take us to the inside of of that
44:11: what are you working on with this next
44:13: exhibit
44:14: okay first of all i have to show you a
44:15: picture of hard rock because we want to
44:17: know who we're dealing with here so
44:19: here's barbara thomas with one of her
44:21: works
44:22: super cute picture of her i like it and
44:24: i know she looks like she's age 35
44:27: um but um she has she's looking back on
44:31: kind of a long career she keeps telling
44:33: me she's somewhere in her night
44:34: in her 60s and i don't believe it
44:40: and um she um
44:42: [Music]
44:44: god there's so many things i need to
44:46: tell you about barbara
44:48: so her parents uh grew up in the south
44:51: and moved to the pacific northwest
44:54: so she's a she's a northwesterner but
44:58: she
44:58: um grew up with the traditions and um
45:02: ah so many stories and mythologies that
45:06: connect her back to the south that's an
45:07: important part
45:08: um kind of of her uh background
45:12: and storytelling in particular is
45:15: something that she was always drawn to
45:18: and um and kind of the grand stories
45:21: about
45:21: life and death actually she lost her
45:23: parents very tragically
45:25: in a i think it was a boating accident
45:30: and she lost them early on um so kind of
45:33: growing up you know here in the region
45:37: with relatives much you know beloved
45:40: and and everything but i'm sure that the
45:43: sense of loss that you care
45:44: that you carry around with yourself is
45:47: is also something that
45:48: um informs who you are so
45:52: she studied at the university of
45:53: washington in the 1970s
45:56: as you were saying she's a she's a
45:59: fabulous writer
46:01: she's also someone who has this
46:04: incredible capacity to make everyone
46:07: feel completely comfortable yes so
46:11: if you're talking about really difficult
46:13: issues
46:15: like the country is right now like like
46:18: a dozen
46:18: issues right now that we could yes dive
46:20: into sure
46:22: yep but you know as she puts it you know
46:25: the issues around
46:28: race and the color line that that have a
46:30: very long
46:31: and and very complicated history in this
46:33: country
46:34: and the repercussions of um of all of
46:38: that
46:38: in everyday life i mean this this has
46:40: been the year where all of this has come
46:43: to a boiling point
46:45: these are these are thoughts she's been
46:48: thinking about for a very long time
46:50: but oftentimes i have one more fun
46:53: picture to tell you
46:54: i'll show you before i can share with
46:56: you what she's now making
46:58: so he studied print making
47:02: uh in painting at the university of
47:04: washington studied with
47:06: jacob lawrence famous famous artist
47:08: amongst others
47:09: so yeah it's a bit hard to see no we can
47:12: see it we can see it it's cool
47:16: so this piece is called in case
47:20: of flood so there is sometimes really
47:23: biblical
47:24: implications you know it's like there's
47:26: a lot going on
47:27: um but
47:31: the the kind of imagery can become a
47:34: metaphor for thinking about
47:36: you know all of these big questions that
47:39: we have to wrestle with
47:41: and so going back to the question of
47:44: what is it like
47:45: to work with an artist so i met barbara
47:50: maybe in 2013 a couple of years after i
47:52: moved here to uh
47:54: to seattle and um
47:57: you know i've done a number of studio
47:59: visits with her over the years actually
48:01: one of the really fun things you get to
48:02: do as a curator of contemporary art
48:04: you know you want to see what artists
48:07: are working on
48:08: um so when i go traveling when i'm here
48:11: in town
48:12: you know it's it's it's wonderful to ask
48:14: artists if they would invite you to
48:16: their studio and share their thoughts
48:18: and ideas
48:19: so we we've had a longer conversation
48:22: already
48:23: and um when we asked if she would
48:27: do an exhibition with us at the ciel art
48:29: museum
48:32: she decided she was going to make all
48:34: new work for the show
48:35: but there's one kind of hanging
48:37: structure that's pre-existing but
48:38: otherwise it's
48:39: all new work and instead of the more
48:43: complex visual imagery
48:46: she had done before she was really
48:49: tearing it down and what she decided to
48:52: do for this exhibition is
48:55: she she singled out portraits a lot of
48:59: them are friends and family
49:01: so kind of she builds a sense of
49:03: community but of very
49:05: young black
49:09: boys and girls then i have to show you
49:11: some
49:12: let's see which ones before
49:17: and they they oopsies it's a little
49:20: stupid here
49:21: um they almost look if you can see that
49:23: as if they were illuminated from behind
49:26: it'd be like that yellow and orange and
49:29: red and a little blue behind it yeah
49:31: jumping off the black yeah so it's
49:34: it's it's kind of hard to
49:38: explain because it's not a
49:41: it's not a print but she cuts paper
49:45: and puts um different colors behind it
49:48: to give it
49:48: almost the appearance of a of an
49:51: illumination it's something that
49:53: happened after she did a glass residency
49:56: and so i just showed you this very spare
49:58: one
49:59: um which was actually inspired by a
50:02: photograph
50:04: of uh it was inspired by it by a
50:08: just photograph she saw in the media of
50:11: a couple of
50:12: young like uh kids at a demonstration
50:14: and one of them held the sign
50:16: don't shoot very much to our moment of
50:19: course
50:20: and um but rather than
50:24: dwell on everything that's really
50:28: so traumatic for for
50:31: everybody especially people in the black
50:33: community uh but really it concerns the
50:36: entire country and everyone
50:38: she wanted to focus on the much larger
50:42: issue of
50:43: you know what do i want to see so she
50:46: replaced
50:47: sign don't shoot with grace that was the
50:51: one i just showed you
50:53: and really what she's trying to do is um
50:56: i'm gonna
50:57: show you one more of those portraits you
50:58: can see how a lot more color
51:00: then entered those portraits here's
51:03: another really gorgeous one
51:06: um yeah it's all paper but it's layers
51:10: of paper right
51:12: and um and and so you're saying
51:16: katarina you're saying when you when the
51:19: museum said hey let's do this exhibit
51:20: she's like i'm gonna
51:22: i'm gonna do all new work for this and
51:25: and i i guess what strikes me about this
51:28: is that
51:29: here's this woman who um has such a
51:32: powerful voice
51:33: and instead of taking from a huge body
51:36: of
51:37: artwork that she has already got she's
51:39: basically
51:40: inviting us into the conversation of the
51:44: day through her artwork and i
51:46: i love this picture because i feel like
51:50: these are hard topics to talk about um
51:53: they're not easily understood
51:55: um and there is um there's something
51:59: um it's like the same thing as song it
52:01: like you can discuss something you could
52:03: sing something
52:04: you could eat something you could
52:05: experience something and here i think
52:07: she is doing this remarkable job of
52:08: inviting us
52:09: into the complexity and the difficulties
52:12: of the issues
52:12: and forcing us to consider in this way
52:16: topics that we need to consider how in
52:19: the how in the
52:20: how in the world do you intersect with
52:22: that
52:23: this is literally a dialogue that you
52:25: guys are having i mean is that
52:27: when we're curating we're not just
52:29: choose like you said earlier we're not
52:30: choosing
52:31: paintings from rembrandt from a bunch of
52:33: years ago you're literally having this
52:35: conversation with her is that right
52:37: that's exactly right and um
52:41: yeah so it it unfolds and also i mean
52:44: it's important to remember
52:46: barbara arrived at this work
52:49: not because of everything that happened
52:51: this year she started this work a year
52:53: ago in 2019
52:56: and it's more that she was she was
53:00: really
53:01: um trying to draw on the
53:04: fullness of her experience as a thinker
53:07: as a writer as a visual artist to
53:11: put put us regardless of our
53:14: race and generationally or class
53:17: in front of these young faces and
53:21: um and their expressions are so disor
53:24: disarming and trustful and the title of
53:27: her exhibition is
53:28: the geography of innocence um
53:31: gives you already a a sense of um
53:35: where she's going because you know the
53:36: idea of how we look at one another
53:39: is at the heart of what she's doing and
53:42: in a very material way the way we
53:45: perceive
53:46: light and dark right i mean going back
53:49: to
53:50: stories of the bible you know the light
53:53: of god
53:54: and darkness is being construed
53:57: themes that are woven deep into uh is
53:59: culturally like what we're
54:01: right she and and and since she's doing
54:03: it ala minute to use a restaurant term
54:06: it's got to be risky for her in the
54:09: sense i mean
54:10: earlier you said you want to think that
54:11: jenny was so good as understanding those
54:13: that took risk or the thing that
54:14: hallmark's
54:15: distinguishes a special piece is that
54:16: you see the artist on this edge
54:19: and so this has got to be a leap for her
54:22: i would imagine
54:24: to sort of have the pressure of clark
54:25: museum be like cool we're going to put
54:27: you in here and she's like cool
54:28: i'm going to create for this like right
54:31: now and i
54:32: uh i i i want to come like i
54:36: i don't want to put words in your mouth
54:37: but i guess what i'm feeling from her is
54:39: the bravery
54:40: and the audacity to be that um
54:44: that risky maybe that bold i dig it i
54:47: i really i really agree and also you
54:49: know paper
54:50: and and printmaking and paper is
54:52: something that she has a long history
54:54: with but glass is relatively new for her
54:56: so what i showed you right now some of
54:58: those portraits are these beautiful
55:00: cut paper portraits that really look as
55:02: if they're glowing from within
55:05: and then she's creating and this is
55:07: really new and talk about risk-taking
55:09: she's creating several glass portraits
55:14: that are also illuminated from behind
55:16: that's a whole new process in fact she
55:18: is still
55:20: working on two more everybody please
55:22: keep your fingers crossed
55:23: because it's been complicated one of
55:26: them broke
55:28: you know this thing goes live in
55:30: november right
55:31: so yeah no pressure here barbara but
55:34: yeah this is like real life
55:35: like yeah glass breaks okay hold on a
55:38: second
55:39: i've got a we have a zillion questions
55:41: coming in and and like
55:43: and like in less than 10 minutes to
55:45: cover them before we jump to
55:46: we'll do like a rapid fire question and
55:48: answer but
55:50: i'm i'm fighting for time with the crew
55:52: over here but before we do i want to ask
55:54: my one question then you can ask yours
55:56: the one character trait from barbara
55:59: that you just that that um
56:03: i don't know that just distinguishes her
56:04: the the um
56:06: your favorite your favorite thing about
56:07: her
56:10: my favorite thing about barbara is
56:11: sitting down and talking with her i
56:13: think i mentioned to you yesterday
56:15: i i feel it's been such a
56:18: such an incredible gift this year as we
56:21: if we've been in the pandemic if we've
56:23: been
56:24: watching the horrors of george floyd and
56:26: brionna taylor
56:28: to be able to work on this exhibition
56:31: with barbara who is
56:34: such a close listener who
56:38: always strives to bring people together
56:42: you know there's so much anger in
56:44: society right now
56:45: and she's aiming hi
56:49: she's like let's we're all human
56:52: essentially
56:53: you know can we just be present
56:56: to the fact that we're looking at these
56:58: young children can you see them
57:01: as children full of aspirations of
57:04: hopes can you be invested in their
57:06: futures
57:08: regardless of who you are and um just
57:11: before we go into those other questions
57:13: so she's creating a
57:14: whole there's going to be like two uh
57:17: related galleries
57:18: one of them is a place
57:22: only with light and shadows so
57:25: you as the viewer is going to be in the
57:26: shadow and the portraits are going to be
57:28: in the light i think it's going to be
57:30: quite astounding cool on the forefront
57:33: of the some of the most important work
57:35: we could do as a country right now
57:37: um is barbara earl thomas and i it let
57:40: me just say it super directly if you're
57:41: watching this thing you haven't figured
57:43: out you need to go online buy a ticket
57:44: and go to see this thing i
57:45: dig do yourself a favor let's can we
57:47: jump into we're gonna do like a rapid
57:49: fire question answer as these things are
57:51: sort of stacking up
57:52: yeah uh who is the most
57:56: influential contemporary artist that
57:57: came out of the pacific northwest
57:59: most influential contemporary artist out
