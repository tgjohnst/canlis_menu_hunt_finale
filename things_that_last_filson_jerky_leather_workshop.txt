00:01:42 and um you know we are our oldest
00:01:45 garment patent is from 1914 which is a
00:01:47 mackinac
00:01:49 it's it's it was styled off the mackinac
00:01:50 it's the previous version of a mackinaw
00:01:52 wool jacket that's what everybody had
00:01:53 known

00:02:20 into something
00:02:21 different you can make it into a handbag
00:02:24 talk about that piece of what filson
00:02:26 does with the really old garments
00:02:27 because people could be watching at home
00:02:28 and have really old garments from filson
00:02:30 and people are curious about that whole
00:02:32 program
00:02:33 okay so we basically have a very
00:02:35 extensive return policy
00:02:36 um we do in-house repairs on a lot of
00:02:39 people's garments
00:02:40 if there is um you know any kind of
00:02:42 damaged holes seam rips
00:02:44 those kind of things that are covered
00:02:45 under the warranty we will repair
00:02:47 uh it takes a few weeks to get things
00:02:49 repaired
00:02:51 we also have within our our company is
00:02:54 it's called
00:02:55 filson workshop and restoration we do
00:02:58 restoration bags where we
00:03:00 have decommissioned filson bags and and
00:03:02 given a new product to a customer
00:03:04 in return for their their bag that they
00:03:06 that has met its end of life
00:03:08 what the team will do is completely
00:03:11 strip down the bag
00:03:12 and and fix everything that they
00:03:14 possibly can zippers
00:03:16 holes they darn the holes they re-wax
00:03:18 they repair leather
00:03:19 it's a complete restoration and we take
00:03:21 it back to as close to original as
00:03:22 possible
00:03:23 awesome within that we also get
00:03:26 garments so we only do restoration on on
00:03:29 the bags we've done some restoration of
00:03:31 the apparel it's not as big of a program
00:03:34 as the
00:03:35 bags portion um but as far as like chaps
00:03:38 and things like that we also have
00:03:39 workshop product where
00:03:41 we didn't believe that making another
00:03:44 bag
00:03:44 out of other pieces of filson
00:03:47 um decommissioned product was really a
00:03:49 technically a restoration so we
00:03:51 we just developed a workshop product
00:03:53 line and we'll make new silhouettes
00:03:56 and old silhouettes and use different
00:03:58 materials so if i were to go come to
00:03:59 philson and buy a leather bag
00:04:01 i could pass it down to my kids and my
00:04:03 grandkids and they could return it in a
00:04:04 hundred years one day
00:04:06 and you guys would like fix it and make
00:04:07 sure it's still good yeah they can bring
00:04:08 it back and the warranty is still

00:07:17 we do a brief overview of
00:07:18 what the materials are so here's our so
00:07:21 filson
00:07:21 we you know we pride ourselves in the
00:07:23 top of the line product
00:07:24 as far as materials and things like that
00:07:26 just to build things to last
00:07:28 this is a full grain english bridal
00:07:30 leather from wicked and craig out of
00:07:31 pennsylvania one of three
00:07:33 tanner uh vegetarians left in the
00:07:34 country what is what does that mean to
00:07:36 be a vegetanery
00:07:38 so a veg tannery they use all natural
00:07:40 ingredients in their tanning of the
00:07:41 leather so they use
00:07:42 a combination of different barks
00:07:44 different oils
00:07:45 waxes and tannins in their tanning
00:07:47 solution when they when they create this
00:07:48 vegetarian leather
00:07:50 you can usually tell a veg tan leather
00:07:52 um
00:07:54 multiple different things most chrome
00:07:55 tan so there's veg tan chrome tan
00:07:58 are your two most common tannings of
00:08:00 leather um
00:08:02 veg tan you can tell there's usually a a
00:08:05 secondary color in the edge when you cut
00:08:07 split through it it's usually just kind
00:08:08 of like a i see that a flesh color is
00:08:10 what i like to call it yeah that's just
00:08:12 where the
00:08:13 um the colors and the pigments and
00:08:15 things that they've used for coloring on
00:08:16 top are on the back cabin penetrated the
00:08:18 core fibers which makes it
00:08:20 um you know the strongest available
00:08:22 leather on the market
00:08:23 got it so that is the leather here we
00:08:26 have our
00:08:26 20 24 ounce or 26 ounce mackinaw wool
00:08:31 pendleton version wool what does
00:08:32 mackinac mean it's just the term we've
00:08:34 given it
00:08:35 yeah it's like when i say mackinaw world
00:08:36 that's kind of isn't the red and black
00:08:38 plaid like the classic filson
00:08:41 correct yes it's like as classic as it
00:08:43 gets yes
00:08:44 and then we have
00:08:47 three different materials here one is
00:08:49 your dry tin
00:08:51 our rugged twill which is used on most
00:08:53 of all of our luggage
00:08:54 and then you have the oil tin which is a
00:08:57 wax these are all paraffin wax based
00:09:00 the oil tin is just a waxed version of
00:09:02 the dry tin
00:09:03 uh john will get into that more when we
00:09:06 get to the waxing and conditioning and
00:09:07 those last two are the exact same
00:09:09 correct but we're going to use them
00:09:10 differently tonight correct one's going
00:09:11 to be used for the field repair and
00:09:13 one's going to be used so
00:09:13 part one leather grab your piece of
00:09:17 leather talk to me about smell it i'd
00:09:20 like you guys just to if you can just
00:09:22 pick up the leather
00:09:23 and take a nice good whiff this is
00:09:26 really how you can
00:09:28 you know leather people know the real
00:09:30 smell of quality leather
00:09:32 a lot of times you can pick up leather
00:09:34 smell it kind of has like a
00:09:37 i would say like a gluey smell it's
00:09:39 usually not the best leather
00:09:40 when you when you smell the real high
00:09:43 quality full grain leather you know
00:09:45 exactly what it smells like
00:09:47 it's an easy way to identify if a belt
00:09:49 that you're buying for
00:09:50 however much you're paying just that
00:09:51 brian
00:09:53 it shows up and it has some kind of
00:09:55 water repellent yeah well but it's gonna
00:09:57 at the end of the night maybe have more
00:09:59 water repellency right
00:10:00 exactly that is the plan
00:10:04 maybe you can just write this i was i
00:10:05 told you i was gonna return this tonight
00:10:07 but maybe
00:10:08 not with the beer on it so and you know
00:10:10 there are many different types of
00:10:12 leathers that we use and are also out on
00:10:14 the market
00:10:14 um specifically our veg tan leather is
00:10:17 all aniline finish which means it does
00:10:19 not have any pigment there's slight
00:10:20 color a lot of colors
00:10:22 created during the tanning process um
00:10:24 this is this is no color added
00:10:26 there's a slight spray slight slight not
00:10:29 much at all but
00:10:30 just a superficial here we have a more
00:10:33 pigmented type
00:10:34 so this is our full grain bridal leather
00:10:36 um we wanted to try to make a safety
00:10:37 orange leather
00:10:38 um and you can really feel when you're
00:10:40 when you're looking at
00:10:42 pigmented and non-pigmented leather
00:10:44 there's something that's called drag
00:10:45 which you can
00:10:46 you can't really see on camera but you
00:10:48 can run your finger across
00:10:50 leathers that have a high pigment which
00:10:52 is acrylic paint basically
00:10:54 and it's just a drier drier drag
00:10:57 it's much it kind of moves across the
00:11:00 leather fast
00:11:01 and is that good or bad or it just is
00:11:03 what it is and it's just
00:11:04 it is what it is yeah um when you have
00:11:06 an aniline finish where there isn't as
00:11:08 much pigment
00:11:09 and acrylic paint the drag is slower you
00:11:11 can just feel it
00:11:12 if you if you want to drag yours you can
00:11:14 feel the difference between that and
00:11:15 that
00:11:16 got to apply the same pressure to kind
00:11:18 of get a knife this feels more
00:11:20 animally yes more real there you go it's
00:11:23 grabbing at your finger more as you drag
00:11:24 it across
00:11:26 yes so like that one time a bear grabbed
00:11:28 at my hand there you go
00:11:29 yeah and there's also different
00:11:31 treatments in within
00:11:32 the leather so you know aniline finish
00:11:35 these are both aniline finished this is
00:11:36 aniline finish here as well
00:11:37 these have been tumbled you can kind of
00:11:39 see the the crinkling effect
00:11:41 i don't know if uh i don't know which
00:11:43 that it comes across so this is created
00:11:45 by
00:11:46 tumbling it in the drum and adding heat
00:11:48 so i often see that like in fashion
00:11:51 yep and white why it's just a look it's
00:11:54 just a look yep and it's just achieved
00:11:56 by tumbling and tumbling it softens it
00:11:58 makes it more applicable in certain
00:12:00 situations like a bag okay yeah you're
00:12:03 gonna
00:12:03 it's it's gonna be really hard to make a
00:12:05 a tote bag
00:12:07 rigid veg tan leather you tumble it to
00:12:09 soften it up and just kind of create
00:12:10 some
00:12:11 not not so rigid okay type of weather
00:12:15 um and you have other this is kind of an
00:12:16 exotic skin this is uh
00:12:18 a moose hide um we haven't made anything
00:12:22 out of that but we also use deer skin
00:12:23 and elk and all kinds of different
00:12:25 leathers
00:12:27 and not to ask a stupid question but all
00:12:29 leather is is the skin of an animal
00:12:31 yes it's just like you're it's like
00:12:34 in this case that this cow that gave its
00:12:37 life for this leather
00:12:39 this is a so are they all also used for
00:12:41 beef is that
00:12:42 because it's a by-product of the meat
00:12:43 industry so wicked and crank it's
00:12:46 you know they're most all their hides
00:12:48 from a byproduct of the meat industry it
00:12:50 comes into the tannerias hair on hide
00:12:52 full on brine
00:12:53 salted skins it's a it's quite the
00:12:56 experience to visit a tannery if you
00:12:57 ever get a chance
00:12:58 wow okay so tonight with our leather
00:13:00 that i'm holding
00:13:01 yes what should we learn uh so here
00:13:03 we're just gonna go ahead and go over
00:13:05 just how to gently condition your
00:13:07 leather so if you want to open up your
00:13:08 little
00:13:10 nifty canisters of wax and conditioner
00:13:13 the black label is your leather
00:13:15 conditioner
00:13:15 which i developed
00:13:19 it is all natural i did develop this is
00:13:21 like your recipe
00:13:23 uh the company that i worked with yes we
00:13:25 built the recipe together
00:13:26 has a beautiful balsam fur undertone
00:13:29 it's very nice it's all cosmetic great
00:13:31 ingredients
00:13:32 like we were just saying leather hides
00:13:36 it's a skin and it should be treated
00:13:37 like a skin
00:13:40 the most important thing with leather is
00:13:41 you want to hydrate your weather you
00:13:43 want to condition you want to keep it
00:13:44 moist
00:13:44 you don't want to overdo it because that
00:13:46 can create rot within your leather
00:13:48 here's a perfect example of a belt
00:13:50 that's needing some love
00:13:52 in certain areas uh it starts to
00:13:54 discolor
00:13:55 the top grain can start to wear off
00:13:58 by conditioning it you're moisturizing
00:14:00 it also you're reducing reducing the
00:14:02 friction
00:14:03 on the surface surface of the weather so
00:14:04 if people have an old belt right now
00:14:06 would you recommend they go get it i
00:14:07 mean
00:14:07 is that if if if they see something like
00:14:09 this in their closet
00:14:11 you should just go grab it right now you
00:14:12 mean it's like it's a little bit cracky
00:14:14 it's a little bit crazy
00:14:16 your hands after when they're like
00:14:19 cracky and gross
00:14:20 absolutely in the middle of arizona in
00:14:22 the summer and
00:14:24 quality leather products you're saying
00:14:26 need to be fed moisture
00:14:28 or you will destroy them yeah honestly i
00:14:30 mean
00:14:31 high quality leather down to you know
00:14:33 your genuine leather or
00:14:35 above that um the uh
00:14:39 split i can't remember the third grade
00:14:42 sorry so even like there's different
00:14:43 grades of quality of leathers full grain
00:14:45 top grain
00:14:46 split grain genuine leather and bonded
00:14:49 leather
00:14:50 should i condition like my nice wallet
00:14:52 that's made out of leather
00:14:53 absolutely okay i mean here's a perfect
00:14:55 example of a wallet that i've been
00:14:57 conditioning
00:14:58 it was close to this color when i first
00:15:01 got it
00:15:01 um i've conditioned it once or twice
00:15:03 i've had it for about a year now
00:15:05 and what it does is it helps build
00:15:06 patina it keeps it nice and soft
00:15:09 and it makes it last forever absolutely
00:15:11 you're not going to get dry rot you're
00:15:12 not going to get crack work
00:15:13 you know if you didn't condition this
00:15:15 you might have cracking that starts
00:15:16 along the spine here where it's flexed
00:15:18 quite a bit
00:15:19 and so your leather conditioner is made
00:15:22 of all natural ingredients
00:15:23 all cosmetic great ingredients okay a
00:15:25 lot goes a long way
00:15:27 with this stuff you really just kind of
00:15:30 rub your finger around light gentle
00:15:31 pressure you'll start to see the oil
00:15:34 or the wax melt with the heat of your
00:15:36 finger
00:15:37 and that's you know there's some oil
00:15:39 there you can pull out a little bit more
00:15:41 oh wow it turns into oil correct correct
00:15:44 so there's a lot of coconut oil in there
00:15:46 and other oils as well
00:15:47 so when you're when you're conditioning
00:15:48 your leather you want to
00:15:50 whatever you're conditioning you should
00:15:51 probably first pick an inconspicuous
00:15:54 area of whatever you're going to
00:15:55 condition because it will change the
00:15:56 tone
00:15:57 of the green so if you're taking an old
00:15:59 old belt or an old
00:16:01 wallet or something like that and you
00:16:02 want to start conditioning it i mean
00:16:04 immediately it's so dry that it just it
00:16:07 sucks
00:16:08 up so much of the conditioner and it
00:16:09 darkens it now
00:16:11 and you're making the leather so happy
00:16:12 correct yeah and it's gonna tomorrow
00:16:14 that'll be gone
00:16:15 it'll just continue to soak in and oh
00:16:17 wow so
00:16:18 because it's so dry i'm sure the the
00:16:21 core fibers of the leather are
00:16:23 are quite dry too so it's just gonna
00:16:25 soak so
00:16:26 so with my home sample can i correct
00:16:28 just take a little bit on your finger
00:16:30 and pick an area on there and just kind
00:16:32 of start rubbing it in
00:16:35 spread it around and you'll see it start
00:16:38 to dissipate and kind of soak into the
00:16:39 pores of the leather
00:16:40 jeremy well you guys are doing that
00:16:42 because people are just wondering like
00:16:43 can we do this with sort of any handbag
00:16:46 any filson bag like any quality piece of
00:16:48 leather is
00:16:49 is this definitely work on my dining
00:16:51 room my leather denim chairs
00:16:52 my leather sofa like how universal is
00:16:56 is it good is it yeah i mean you can
00:16:58 always test that your your sofa leather
00:17:00 things like that
00:17:01 sometimes a lot of those leather
00:17:02 leathers that are used on you know
00:17:05 different bags and things like that have
00:17:06 a lot of pigment and will resist
00:17:09 absorbing that conditioner because the
00:17:12 pores and the grain of the leather are
00:17:14 closed off by the paint
00:17:15 okay so what you can do is you can try
00:17:17 it rub it in there don't
00:17:18 leave it there for a little bit if it
00:17:20 soaks in like the next day
00:17:22 great it's absorbing and it's
00:17:23 conditioning the weather but you're not
00:17:24 going to hurt it you're not going to
00:17:25 hurt you're
00:17:26 adding this to it no it might just cause
00:17:28 a little bit of disc
00:17:29 color discoloration but not much
00:17:32 so you kind of rub that in and if you
00:17:34 have any left over after you do that
00:17:37 you just hit it with any kind of a dry
00:17:40 soft cloth i don't wait till
00:17:42 the next day to hit it with a drop i
00:17:43 would let it soak in let it soak
00:17:45 overnight and the next day kind of buff
00:17:47 it
00:17:47 yeah if if there's any kind of resi you
00:17:49 know residual kind of residue or
00:17:51 anything like that which i wouldn't
00:17:52 suspect and then you just kind of wipe
00:17:54 it down okay so i knew we're talking
00:17:56 about leather tonight
00:17:57 and i thought i'd put this to the test
00:18:00 um i went pumpkin
00:18:01 picking a couple weeks ago with my kids
00:18:04 in my leather boots
00:18:05 and i came back and my boot looked like
00:18:08 this
00:18:09 which is super gross and it's covered in
00:18:12 mud these are nice these are
00:18:13 handmade leather boots from texas a
00:18:15 place called helm
00:18:17 and uh and i came back and my boots look
00:18:20 like this
00:18:21 what should i do well obviously first
00:18:25 you're going to want to
00:18:26 remove all the dirt um you can do this
00:18:28 in a number of different ways you can
00:18:29 kind of go at it
00:18:30 dry where you just kind of knock off
00:18:32 some of the dirt just be careful not to
00:18:34 you know dent your soul or or scratch
00:18:37 the leather or anything like that
00:18:38 can i use water on it can i kind of
00:18:45 yeah yeah you absolutely um you know i
00:18:48 usually use
00:18:49 a hard bristled nylon toothbrush got it
00:18:51 you can get it
00:18:52 all the dirt off get all the dirt off
00:18:54 you can use it at first yeah you can wet
00:18:56 it first if you'd like and just kind of
00:18:58 use a damp cloth or whatever okay so i
00:19:00 knew you'd probably say get all the
00:19:01 crud off my boots so i cleaned one of
00:19:03 them ah there we go
00:19:04 perfect but i have never i've owned
00:19:06 these boots for a couple years and i've
00:19:08 never put
00:19:08 any leather conditioner on them it's
00:19:10 probably about time
00:19:11 it's about time yeah and so uh i would
00:19:15 make sure it's totally dry
00:19:16 totally dry before after it's clean make
00:19:18 sure it's clean and starting and the
00:19:20 same thing with my hands
00:19:21 correct you can use your hand or you can
00:19:23 use this and does this would this
00:19:25 this thing would cover my problem no
00:19:28 problem like this goes a very long way
00:19:29 absolutely
00:19:30 yeah and if you over did it you would
00:19:32 have
00:19:33 some of it would sit on the surface for
00:19:35 a little while as well so i mean you see
00:19:37 that you you barely put in and you're
00:19:38 doing the whole entire toe cap so
00:19:40 yeah that's crazy yeah and it's really
00:19:42 easy and it's
00:19:43 very easy oh it's so such a nice smell
00:19:45 you uh
00:19:46 you guys sell these at the store correct
00:19:49 but they're bigger
00:19:50 four ounces and they're like 15 bucks or
00:19:52 18 bucks 18
00:19:53 18 bucks for the highest quality
00:19:55 ingredients you can use in a conditioner
00:19:57 for sure
00:19:58 and it will go forever absolutely i mean
00:20:00 four ounces will last you quite
00:20:02 quite a while with uh your leather goods
00:20:04 okay that's awesome so i do my shoes i
00:20:05 do my
00:20:06 wallet i can do my purse i can do any
00:20:08 leather good
00:20:09 any leather good just feed it it's
00:20:11 thirsty and hungry
00:20:13 absolutely that's a good way to put it
00:20:14 [Music]
00:20:16 it's like how often like you're just
00:20:18 looking for you're just sort of looking
00:20:19 for the
00:20:20 cracking or the dryness well if if
00:20:22 you're seeing cracking and dryness it's
00:20:24 it's
00:20:25 a little bit late you should probably
00:20:26 hit it once and then come back in like
00:20:28 two months and do it again but i would
00:20:30 say every six months depending on the
00:20:32 climate you live in
00:20:33 is this waterproof also this actually
00:20:35 does have waterproofing
00:20:37 for those of us in the northwest which
00:20:38 is all of us this month and for the next
00:20:40 five months this is like a great
00:20:42 maintenance thing to do absolutely for
00:20:43 basically all your leather shoes yeah
00:20:44 prior to the winter seasons
00:20:46 yeah for sure it's not suede uh correct
00:20:48 you would not want i mean you can use
00:20:50 this on suede
00:20:51 but you need to make sure that you do it
00:20:53 in a very inconspicuous area because it
00:20:55 will affect the nap
00:20:57 which is the brushed portion of the
00:21:00 suede
00:21:00 which is the lower epidermis of the
00:21:02 weather it's actually very simple you
00:21:03 could do that
00:21:04 it could yes okay but it will like i
00:21:06 said it will change the nap it'll it'll
00:21:08 press it down
00:21:09 there are brushes and things like that
00:21:10 you can use after you've conditioned it
00:21:12 and hit it with the brush
00:21:13 and pull that nap back up i just want to
00:21:16 say it's very satisfying
00:21:17 it's like relaxing after absolutely
00:21:20 after doom scrolling
00:21:21 much of the day on twitter and normally
00:21:22 i suggest taking out the laces so you
00:21:24 can get in there really easily into the
00:21:25 tongue
00:21:26 take the laces out yes all right all
00:21:28 right all right
00:21:29 um and do i want to do the inside or not
00:21:32 not necessarily i mean you can if you
00:21:34 want
00:21:35 your feet might smell nice would i what
00:21:37 about my kids soccer shoes
00:21:39 or but that's maybe not real leather you
00:21:40 need to make sure that it's real weather
00:21:42 there's not many cleats that are made
00:21:44 these days that are real leather
00:21:46 okay yeah my old soccer shoes yeah what
00:21:49 happens if i add those things
00:21:52 are real yeah and it's good
00:21:55 and it's good on my hands actually you
00:21:57 can use like i said cosmetic grade
00:22:00 okay uh okay is there anything else
00:22:02 about leather we should cover before
00:22:04 going to the next thing
00:22:05 uh i mean you know the leather that we
00:22:08 use
00:22:09 has very specific purposes in in the
00:22:12 products we make we use it for straps
00:22:14 and handles
00:22:15 and you know belts and and load
00:22:18 bearing stuff that's why we use such
00:22:20 thick and
00:22:22 and high quality leather there there are
00:22:24 other leathers that are specific for
00:22:26 other products like we were talking
00:22:27 about before chrome
00:22:28 chrome town leathers you know different
00:22:30 colored leathers things like that
00:22:32 exotics um so this is mainly what we use
00:22:36 here at filson
00:22:36 awesome so jeremy one question i want to
00:22:39 make time for
00:22:40 mr deuce coming up here but people just
00:22:42 asking um
00:22:43 filson boot oil finish is for oil tanned
00:22:46 leather
00:22:46 is that different from veg tanned
00:22:48 leather i'm sorry say that question
00:22:50 so uh just the philson boot oil the
00:22:53 philson boot oil correct yeah it seems
00:22:55 to be for oil tanned
00:22:56 leather is oil tan leather different
00:22:58 than
00:22:59 veg tanned leather is that
00:23:03 no not necessarily i mean there's oils
00:23:04 and waxes used in vegetable leather too
00:23:06 so it would work for both correct okay
00:23:08 correct
00:23:10 yes awesome and the boot the boot oil is
00:23:13 is very similar to the conditioner it's
00:23:15 more just liquid form
00:23:16 it's just easier to kind of work around
00:23:18 yeah and it has a little dauber on it
00:23:20 which helps you get into the crevices a
00:23:22 lot easier than trying to shove your
00:23:23 finger in there
00:23:24 one woman asks if she does her couch
00:23:26 which at 10 is probably not going to be
00:23:28 enough for your couch
00:23:29 absolutely not how long to wait before
00:23:30 she sits if she has a soft
00:23:33 pair of pants on can't you just kind of
00:23:35 sit on it right away because you're kind
00:23:36 of like working
00:23:37 yeah i would definitely if you're if
00:23:38 you're going to do your couch it's most
00:23:39 likely
00:23:40 pigmented leather um you should try it
00:23:42 in an area
00:23:43 see where the how far the conditioner
00:23:46 soaks in okay
00:23:47 give it a day okay if it's still on
00:23:49 there you should probably wipe it down
00:23:51 before you go sitting on it because you
00:23:52 don't want that
00:23:53 it is made of oil sit on it with leather
00:23:55 pants that too okay so that we figured
00:23:58 that
00:23:58 out two birds one stone on that one i'd
00:23:59 say
00:24:01 i got a piece of beef jerky that's like
00:24:03 takes a lot of chewing there you go
00:24:05 there you go yeah i mean look at the
00:24:06 difference there beautiful

00:26:48 no it's awesome yeah i love it okay tin
00:26:51 cloth
00:26:52 take us there 10 class so which which i
00:26:55 i need uh the middle three is that right
00:26:58 so yeah what we're gonna be working with
00:27:00 are the middle threes so the lighter
00:27:02 color one
00:27:04 i'm gonna move some of this stuff yeah
00:27:05 get all that leather yeah get that out
00:27:07 of here
00:27:08 jeremy's stuff i know that's a mess so
00:27:10 you guys have probably under
00:27:11 uh undone your stack so we're gonna get
00:27:13 the lighter color one
00:27:16 this darker one and then of course
00:27:20 the twill which feels which is like the
00:27:22 thickest one yeah so what we can do what
00:27:24 these are some of our heritage uh
00:27:26 textiles that we use at filson
00:27:28 okay um we use tin cloth which is
00:27:31 the waxed one here in the middle the
00:27:33 darkest one okay this is going to be a
00:27:34 15 ounce
00:27:36 waxed canvas it's been
00:27:39 pushed through heavy heated rollers
00:27:42 with wax on that and it impregnates and
00:27:45 gets really deep into
00:27:47 that does that happen here in seattle no
00:27:50 no we buy it from our uh supplier that
00:27:52 way okay
00:27:53 and and am i right and when these first
00:27:56 two
00:27:56 is the exact same material it's just one
00:27:59 has wax
00:28:00 that's that's correct so they're the
00:28:01 same weight um meaning the same
00:28:04 uh how dense it is and how thick it is
00:28:06 so the same way but this one's been
00:28:08 waxed
00:28:09 now then we have our third piece here
00:28:11 which is our 22 ounce
00:28:14 twill we use this a lot for our luggage
00:28:17 and bags
00:28:18 i'm sure if anyone out there has an
00:28:20 original briefcase
00:28:21 or a had a computer bag or what yeah
00:28:24 it's going to be out of our 22 ounce
00:28:26 twill this is uh comes with
00:28:30 a slight dry finish wax on it so you
00:28:32 can't really
00:28:33 it's not all like juicy like the tin
00:28:35 cloth lightly waxed
00:28:37 lightly waxed okay still very very water
00:28:40 resistant
00:28:40 and it's not just filson that uses uh
00:28:43 waxed
00:28:44 canvas well wax canvas yeah it's uh it's
00:28:47 been around for quite some time
00:28:49 philson we've been using it uh since the
00:28:51 early 1920s and
00:28:53 when you started growing your beard yes
00:28:56 yes
00:29:01 um it's since but but like you were
00:29:03 saying earlier
00:29:04 um like if you have a barber jacket at
00:29:06 home or
00:29:07 there's other great brands that use this
00:29:10 because it's
00:29:11 like what what's the advantage of tin
00:29:13 cloth why is it awesome
00:29:14 well it's cool because in many ways it's
00:29:16 kind of a heritage
00:29:18 sort of piece that's been tried and true
00:29:21 over the years you know
00:29:22 wax canvas essentially started in the
00:29:25 15th century by sailors
00:29:27 what they did is they found out that if
00:29:29 you coated the sail cloth
00:29:32 with fish oil and tar and other things
00:29:35 it helped keep
00:29:36 the sail dry which meant it was less
00:29:39 weight
00:29:40 and it also meant it caught more wind so
00:29:42 it could push the
00:29:43 uh sailboats better so it's been around
00:29:45 for a minute from there it evolved and
00:29:47 got
00:29:47 uh they would take an old sail and be
00:29:49 like this would be a great shirt
00:29:51 well they did they did capes they did
00:29:53 cape coats with that
00:29:54 got it but they eventually changed it
00:29:56 and they went towards literally
00:29:58 because they're waterproof yep so they
00:29:59 started going to the linseed oil game
00:30:02 and then eventually we got around to the
00:30:04 paraffin wax
00:30:05 based um wax canvas which is what we're
00:30:08 using now
00:30:09 which is what's the difference between
00:30:11 wax and paraffin
00:30:13 what makes wax paraffin wax uh well
00:30:15 paraffin wax
00:30:16 it's from what i gather essentially it's
00:30:19 going to be
00:30:20 a petroleum by-product okay uh similar
00:30:23 to
00:30:24 candles and crayons and that sort of
00:30:26 thing that's all paraffin
00:30:27 it's also what they dip your feet in
00:30:29 when you get a pedicure
00:30:31 i've only heard ah so this i love it
00:30:34 so they say okay so keep going
00:30:38 perfect so what um what i'm going to
00:30:41 show you guys today and what we're going
00:30:42 to kind of
00:30:43 do is we're going to re wax
00:30:46 we're going to wax this dry tin dried
00:30:48 tin cloth in the middle the lighter
00:30:50 colored one
00:30:52 so let's be clear can can can people
00:30:54 waxes if in case you're
00:30:55 not a filson garment maybe you're doing
00:30:57 carhartt or something like that
00:30:58 can you wax another fat like another
00:31:02 another cloth in that sense it's just
00:31:04 like this this method works for lots of
00:31:06 things
00:31:06 that's a great question and yes you
00:31:08 absolutely can um
00:31:09 as long as you're using it if you're
00:31:12 going to wax
00:31:14 um your carhartt or whatever just make
00:31:16 sure it's 100
00:31:18 cotton okay you know that way it will
00:31:21 really
00:31:21 take to the wax as i demonstrate uh with
00:31:24 the
00:31:25 heat gun and everything we want it to
00:31:27 really soak
00:31:28 into the fabric and only if it's 100
00:31:30 cotton
00:31:31 so you could do your gardener's hat you
00:31:33 could do you know anything
00:31:35 and your apron and if you want to follow
00:31:36 along at home this would be a moment to
00:31:39 go find
00:31:41 your heat gun which no one has or a blow
00:31:44 dryer
00:31:46 or uh your your friendly neighborhood
00:31:48 fireplace
00:31:49 yeah yeah um great so you will the heat
00:31:52 is
00:31:53 is an essential part of this process yes
00:31:55 okay absolutely
00:31:56 um i use a heat gun because it's fast
00:31:59 i'm waxing stuff
00:32:01 a lot at work and i got to do it quick
00:32:03 so i'm going to use a heat gun to get
00:32:04 hotter faster and everything else you
00:32:06 can
00:32:06 should we plug ours in yeah well i've
00:32:08 got even that one's kind of my
00:32:10 oh my back up oh so i'm this just got
00:32:13 real interesting we got the big guns
00:32:14 here
00:32:15 okay so yeah this um what you're gonna
00:32:18 want
00:32:19 if you do use a hair blower all right
00:32:21 you know put it on the highest setting
00:32:23 you want you want a little as hot as
00:32:25 possible yeah this one what about like a
00:32:27 toaster
00:32:28 could i like you know like a piece of
00:32:30 toast sure
00:32:31 toaster if you want you could uh put it
00:32:34 in your oven put in your oven if you're
00:32:35 dairy like maybe
00:32:36 200 or below like yeah okay let's keep
00:32:39 it safe
00:32:40 okay but in any heat source next to the
00:32:42 fireplace on a hot sunny day outside
00:32:45 anything like that okay
00:32:46 so um hopefully that answered the
00:32:49 gentleman or
00:32:50 whoever's question was well and um
00:32:55 no we'll get there okay let's do this
00:32:58 first okay
00:32:58 let's get the red tin okay
00:33:04 and we're gonna crack that baby open
00:33:07 so this is the also smells delicious
00:33:11 i don't love the smell as much as the
00:33:14 leather conditioner am i wrong i can't
00:33:17 smell it
00:33:20 you can say it smells like i mean the
00:33:21 leather one is like the latter one
00:33:27 so this is the exact same um uh
00:33:31 wax we use here at filson and that we
00:33:32 sell on the retail floor
00:33:34 um what does a tin of this wax cost uh
00:33:37 ten bucks ten bucks oh well the
00:33:39 for three and three point seven five
00:33:42 ounce
00:33:42 can it's ten bucks awesome yeah and
00:33:45 usually with one of those cans
00:33:47 you know you could get pretty close into
00:33:49 getting you know
00:33:50 a full jacket there is this is this the
00:33:53 like
00:33:53 um i bought a tin cloth jacket several
00:33:56 years ago and in the pocket was a tin of
00:33:58 wax yeah
00:33:59 you guys always do that right you
00:34:01 include a tin of wax yep that's a little
00:34:02 sound and you're saying like on this
00:34:04 old stelson jacket 110 would do the
00:34:07 whole jacket
00:34:08 on with the newer can the can you had
00:34:10 was the sample can
00:34:11 one of these why you got to give me the
00:34:12 sample kit sorry man
00:34:14 that's the sample can okay okay
00:34:18 awesome so i brought that one out just
00:34:21 in case too
00:34:21 so what we can do is we'll grab our dry
00:34:23 tin the lightest color one
00:34:25 we're gonna work a little bit on this
00:34:26 one so the idea being that we're wanting
00:34:28 to smooth it out
00:34:30 the best we can and then we'll hit it
00:34:32 with the heat gun and
00:34:33 warm it up to let it soak in okay so i
00:34:36 just sometimes what i like to do
00:34:37 if i'm doing a big project you know i'll
00:34:40 take a business card or a credit card or
00:34:43 whatever it may be
00:34:44 and that way i can almost use it like a
00:34:46 putty knife
00:34:47 and i can apply it all over like that
00:34:50 you know something like that
00:34:53 why a business card and not an actual
00:34:56 because it's soft uh no reason just
00:34:59 because i never use mine
00:35:01 so i mean those things cost as someone
00:35:04 who has expensive business cards yeah
00:35:05 i mean 30 cents each that's nice it's
00:35:07 like at least
00:35:09 at least that's how you're like you just
00:35:11 realize that john uses all his business
00:35:13 cards yeah
00:35:22 yeah i need another box of business
00:35:23 cards so some people who like might be
00:35:25 grabbing an old filson garment yeah
00:35:28 good to clean the garment first before
00:35:30 we wax
00:35:31 is how do you with a brush or how do we
00:35:33 do that absolutely so you're gonna want
00:35:35 to get as much of the
00:35:36 heavier junk off that you can a bristle
00:35:39 brush
00:35:40 um you know you could do some slight
00:35:43 spot cleaning with a sponge
00:35:46 um but for the most part you just want
00:35:49 to get the big big
00:35:50 stuff off because um what what happens
00:35:54 is
00:35:54 basically because of the um
00:35:58 the wax it will attract some debris and
00:36:02 dirt and sawdust and whatnot and it ends
00:36:03 up giving this beautiful patina over
00:36:06 time
00:36:06 but you can't really clean this off
00:36:09 completely
00:36:10 unless you send it out for an enzyme
00:36:11 bath which is a service
00:36:13 they it's a service they uh do at the uh
00:36:16 retail store master to clean all those
00:36:19 marks off the sector
00:36:21 oh you got to earn the market yeah i
00:36:23 mean enzyme baths are no good
00:36:26 marks are good good to know yeah so
00:36:28 because you know this
00:36:30 this takes time to to age and patina to
00:36:33 what you do
00:36:34 in your lifestyle this is earning your
00:36:36 stripes
00:36:37 yeah that's special yeah because well
00:36:40 just
00:36:41 these two jackets are the exact same
00:36:42 product is that right yeah
00:36:44 you see those somewhere um it's the
00:36:46 exact
00:36:47 same the exact same same with these two
00:36:50 as well
00:36:50 and so often like uh if you were to go
00:36:52 try on this jacket in a store it feels
00:36:54 like
00:36:54 you feel like this you're like oh this
00:36:56 isn't nice yeah but you don't realize
00:36:58 that um
00:36:59 those type of like after a while it's
00:37:01 the most comfortable soft thing on earth
00:37:03 yes and that's because it is a hundred
00:37:04 percent
00:37:05 cotton it just it keeps that nice warm
00:37:08 feel to it after it breaks in
00:37:10 so yeah super cool okay so teach me how
00:37:13 to wax okay so what we'll do
00:37:14 um you can use uh you know latex gloves
00:37:18 if you have any uh it is waxed so it
00:37:20 gets kind of sticky on your hands so
00:37:22 i find that uh using as hot as water as
00:37:25 possible to wash my hands after is fine
00:37:28 to get it off uh-huh
00:37:29 okay but it's it's totally up to you
00:37:31 it's not gonna hurt me
00:37:32 no it's just maybe it's just you're just
00:37:34 gonna have yeah a little sticky hand
00:37:35 okay which foot
00:37:36 i mean i can't prepare it again
00:37:40 there the options there i'm gonna go in
00:37:42 i'm 1000. i don't
00:37:44 need it we're good if you're not using
00:37:47 eyes
00:37:48 all right so what we'll do you can see
00:37:52 it's
00:37:52 it's kind of it's it's so different than
00:37:54 the leather it's pretty softer
00:37:56 mm-hmm okay so we'll grab a you know
00:37:59 just get a little dab out of that scoop
00:38:01 the scoop
00:38:02 okay what we're going to do just we can
00:38:04 work on any section
00:38:06 at all the the square here but i'm going
00:38:08 to start in the center again it's the
00:38:10 lightest piece of our three
00:38:11 the lightest of the three mm-hmm okay so
00:38:14 we'll go ahead and just kind of
00:38:17 kind of start spreading that out
00:38:22 as evenly as possible
00:38:26 and you can see it's it's you know i got
00:38:28 it kind of lumpy here and there
00:38:30 that way i can just start kind of
00:38:33 spreading it out more and more
00:38:38 got it and you can tell when you need
00:38:40 more because you just run out
00:38:41 yep can you go too thick or too thin
00:38:46 no i mean you you can go to him the the
00:38:50 the tricky part is doing it even so
00:38:53 you'll
00:38:54 you'll want to make sure you don't go
00:38:56 over the same spots too much
00:38:58 what happens if you don't do it even
00:39:00 just it'll just be discolored or
00:39:01 it'll be just a little bit darker in
00:39:04 that area but
00:39:05 after about a week or two it all just
00:39:08 will kind of come i'm pretty sure that
00:39:09 mine is not even
00:39:10 you know what you're you're crushing it
00:39:12 you're doing great you're doing fine
00:39:17 you don't have to do the whole thing but
00:39:19 we'll just
00:39:21 get it all on here i'm gonna go ahead
00:39:24 and cheat
00:39:25 and just use my business card and you
00:39:27 can't the business kids
00:39:29 i know i'm going to get in so much
00:39:31 trouble for this
00:39:32 and just to be clear do you guys have do
00:39:34 you have multiple waxes
00:39:36 like on the site or it's just sort of
00:39:38 one wax we just have
00:39:39 this we just have uh the one oil finish
00:39:42 wax
00:39:42 one oil finish wax okay and it's just
00:39:44 okay cool so yeah we can get that
00:39:46 awesome and we're doing this piece of
00:39:49 100 cotton
00:39:50 yep i'm wearing an apron could i wax
00:39:53 this
00:39:53 apron yep that's going to be made out of
00:39:56 our dry tin
00:39:57 so you could totally wax that apron and
00:39:59 why would i want to
00:40:00 um you know it's going to really depend
00:40:04 on the application i would do it for
00:40:05 if it was like an outdoor barbecue apron
00:40:07 like my barbecue apron yeah
00:40:09 i don't know if i'd want to have it
00:40:11 waxed inside your house
00:40:12 because you know having it outside is
00:40:16 just you know you might rub against some
00:40:18 hot materials or
00:40:20 sharp corners around the barbecue or
00:40:22 whatever and then it'll provide a little
00:40:23 bit more protection
00:40:24 that way but inside i don't think
00:40:27 generally i'm gonna
00:40:28 choose to apply wax to cotton when i
00:40:31 want it
00:40:31 waterproof uh yeah when we're gonna want
00:40:35 water resistance
00:40:36 okay and then to also strengthen the
00:40:38 canvas as well
00:40:39 you know it because it helps it last
00:40:40 longer it helps it last a lot longer
00:40:42 because it kind of acts almost like a
00:40:44 glue
00:40:45 and it keeps all the fibers really
00:40:46 really close and tight together so even
00:40:48 if you do get a little tiny hole
00:40:50 kind of like on this jacket here yeah
00:40:53 it's not gonna keep spreading
00:40:55 super super big over time it's gonna
00:40:58 it's gonna kind of stay there because
00:40:59 it's kind of so if i get a hole in one
00:41:01 of my garments
00:41:02 i don't necessarily have to sew it i
00:41:03 could wax it all over it and it'll
00:41:05 spread
00:41:06 slow it'll it could help it could help
00:41:08 but it's better just to go ahead and
00:41:10 repair it
00:41:10 wait i just hold on i took these shoe
00:41:12 laces off earlier of my shoes yeah
00:41:14 could i wax my shoelaces sure in fact
00:41:17 it's actually a great idea because again
00:41:20 as i said it acts kind of like a glue
00:41:23 it'll keep all those fibers tight
00:41:25 together and so when you're going
00:41:26 through your speed hooks and eyelets and
00:41:28 your boots
00:41:29 it won't wear down your laces as fast
00:41:31 okay well that's cool
00:41:32 yeah you know kind of burnish over and
00:41:34 out because you know
00:41:36 i wouldn't wax not this hat but uh
00:41:40 don't touch my hat uh like would you
00:41:43 ever wax a hat
00:41:44 um like for a waterproof like your
00:41:47 favorite hunting hat yeah
00:41:48 totally yeah totally as long as it's all
00:41:50 cotton yes
00:41:53 uh rabbit that's rabbit
00:41:56 rabbit fell okay um okay and then
00:42:00 now we've waxed now we gotta apply heat
00:42:02 right and my hands are all
00:42:04 sticky and whatever that's fine because
00:42:06 it's part of
00:42:07 part of the game okay so here's your
00:42:09 heat gun okay
00:42:10 or hair blower heat source
00:42:13 what i'll do first is i'll show you on
00:42:15 mine okay and then you can do yours
00:42:17 okay because what we're gonna do
00:42:20 there's a few things we're gonna kind of
00:42:21 look for right now you i don't know if
00:42:23 the cameras
00:42:24 quite show it but it's pretty shiny
00:42:28 which means it hasn't gotten uh soaked
00:42:31 into the fibers
00:42:32 it might be a little loud here for a
00:42:34 second we'll see but
00:42:36 what i'm gonna do is i'll get this heat
00:42:39 gun going
00:42:41 i'll start working in this area over
00:42:43 here and we'll see this wax
00:42:45 change it'll go from this glossy
00:42:48 sort of top coat to a dull
00:42:52 sort of look and that's what we're going
00:42:53 for got it
00:42:56 oh this thing's hot
00:43:03 so you'll see it start to pull up a
00:43:05 little bit
00:43:06 oh totally and then see how it's so i'll
00:43:09 cut it there
00:43:10 so you can see this area here
00:43:14 has been soaked in and this area has so
00:43:16 that's it it turns from
00:43:17 shiny wet to dry matte yep
00:43:24 and you can see i i need to go a little
00:43:26 bit longer there and a little bit longer
00:43:28 over there
00:43:34 so this is the fastest way to do it but
00:43:36 again you could do it
00:43:38 slowly by the fire or yes just as long
00:43:42 as it's going to end up looking dull
00:43:43 like that
00:43:44 hot sunny day really hot yeah
00:43:48 really hot can you overdo it no no no
00:43:51 if you're going to make a mistake like
00:43:52 get into it like it
00:43:54 this heat gun will get up to 1100
00:43:56 degrees and
00:43:58 if i'm in a hurry i'll just go as fast
00:44:00 and hot as i
00:44:01 can and it'll actually start smoking a
00:44:03 little bit
00:44:04 it's not a big deal it's just actually
00:44:06 not your favorite pair of pants
00:44:08 yeah okay that's awesome i should do my
00:44:10 laces hold on
00:44:12 does it make like i have a pair of
00:44:14 hunting pants does it does it make the
00:44:15 pants
00:44:16 uh water resistant but is it more
00:44:18 resistant to abrasion
00:44:19 thorns and that kind of stuff is just
00:44:20 100 okay yeah
00:44:22 yep because the thorns they don't end up
00:44:25 getting snagged like on
00:44:26 nylon or anything else it just slides
00:44:29 across it just skates across you know
00:44:32 it's like my fingernail
00:44:35 yeah friction reducer sure cool
00:44:40 nice it's awesome you got your lace done
00:44:42 i got a lace a lace
00:44:45 so that's the tin cloth mine you can see
00:44:48 i didn't really do it very even because
00:44:51 there's a little bit darker spot but
00:44:52 it's no big deal because we'll let this
00:44:55 cure
00:44:56 overnight it's patina and it'll probably
00:44:59 even itself out a little bit
00:45:01 why isn't the one i just did as dark as
00:45:04 the one that was pre-waxed well because
00:45:08 this is
00:45:08 done by the machine and it's perfect
00:45:10 like i said it's done by machine it's
00:45:12 right it's put through rollers the
00:45:13 fabric is more wax so
00:45:15 yeah it really gets packed in there and
00:45:18 so that's the idea behind reproofing and
00:45:20 re-waxing
00:45:21 is maintaining that okay and we're
00:45:24 almost out of time with this part but
00:45:26 the canvas a honda twill this is the
00:45:29 twill the twill i could also do
00:45:31 yeah this this uh it does come with a
00:45:33 light dry wax on it but
00:45:35 again if you want that really rich
00:45:37 patina worn and looked and
00:45:39 the durability of the wax you can go
00:45:41 ahead and do that that's no big deal
00:45:43 it also is a little tricky to it's
00:45:46 harder to apply
00:45:47 uh-huh it's it's trickier to apply
00:45:49 evenly and it takes a lot more wax
00:45:55 my bag that i carry every day i brought
00:45:58 stuff
00:46:00 is this bag i'm not i'm i'm
00:46:03 actually a customer of yours um this is
00:46:05 my everyday
00:46:06 briefcase that i take to work he leaves
00:46:10 it on the floor
00:46:11 yeah you tripping the whole trip over
00:46:12 the entire office trips from this bed
00:46:17 i've had it uh about three or four years
00:46:19 okay and
00:46:21 should i to take care of it should i
00:46:24 should i wax it should i jeremy should i
00:46:26 be
00:46:27 feeding the leather handles absolutely i
00:46:30 haven't done that
00:46:31 yes yes yeah well so this blue stuff
00:46:34 here
00:46:35 this is the uh the tin cloth so you can
00:46:37 absolutely wax that
00:46:39 in fact i would it's pretty dry i can
00:46:40 kind of feel how dry it is i'm sorry
00:46:43 come on yeah i know until it's very dry
00:46:45 yep and then this
00:46:47 panel here is the twill actually but in
00:46:49 blue
00:46:50 and you can wax that as well so got it
00:46:52 and that'll just make it last longer
00:46:54 and be healthier and be waterproof
00:46:56 really yeah absolutely
00:46:58 there was a one over here that i saw
00:47:00 earlier it might be yours
00:47:01 just need some help i just did the
00:47:02 leather it looks great thank you
00:47:04 it's a good looking bag wait hold on you

00:49:29 you make things with your hands and your
00:49:31 store and yes uh you're the sewing
00:49:34 master
00:49:35 i wouldn't say that i think i uh those
00:49:38 guys say
00:49:39 so i tend more towards the sewing than i
00:49:41 do to the leather work just because i
00:49:43 have less experience
00:49:44 with the leather but i have learned a
00:49:45 ton since i've been here from john
00:49:47 and our other co-workers and jeremy yep
00:49:49 yeah yeah
00:49:50 covered pretty much everything there's
00:49:52 nothing else to know so yeah okay so
00:49:54 teach
00:49:54 what what are you gonna teach us tonight
00:49:55 okay so today we're going to be
00:49:57 learning how to do what is called a
00:49:59 field repair we're calling a field
00:50:01 repair which is just to say
00:50:02 when you're out in the field and
00:50:05 uh something happens you snag something
00:50:08 your coat
00:50:09 um gets a rip in it just a quick easy
00:50:11 way
00:50:12 to sew it up um and we're just going to
00:50:14 use a whip stitch and i don't know where
00:50:16 any of my tools went whip stitch
00:50:19 would you mind handing me one of those
00:50:21 packets and a pair of scissors please
00:50:23 perfect one of those a pair of scissors
00:50:26 perfect
00:50:26 okay oh this one's already open i'm
00:50:28 gonna just eat some jerky while you're
00:50:30 talking
00:50:30 perfect um i'm also gonna steal one of
00:50:33 these from you
00:50:33 do it thank you all right so um
00:50:37 for this we're just gonna you can put
00:50:38 whatever kind of hole you want in here
00:50:40 and we're gonna
00:50:41 just stitch it up so this is the last
00:50:43 piece we haven't used yet
00:50:44 yeah so you had well you have we're
00:50:46 gonna use this one
00:50:47 next but first we're gonna use another
00:50:49 piece of the
00:50:50 oil tin so you got two of those one john
00:50:52 was showing you
00:50:53 with the um waxing demonstration and the
00:50:55 other one we're just going to show how
00:50:56 to
00:50:57 sew it up so just poke a hole if there
00:50:59 should be another pair of scissors over
00:51:01 there
00:51:02 i'm going to use i'm going to use a pin
00:51:04 yeah i'm just going to put okay i broke
00:51:05 the pen
00:51:06 that's the high quality that fills it in
00:51:09 exactly i just break this
00:51:10 pour pen in half oh there's more
00:51:12 scissors there you go yeah
00:51:14 or something yes so put a roll on it
00:51:17 rip it open a little bit just to
00:51:19 simulate what it's actually going to be
00:51:20 like if you put a rip in it rather than
00:51:21 a clean
00:51:22 cut because rarely are you gonna get a
00:51:24 clean cut i really that's okay
00:51:26 is it okay that's totally fine okay um
00:51:29 great the dirtier it is the harder it is
00:51:31 to finish but um
00:51:32 that's okay all right so um you're gonna
00:51:36 open up your little sewing packet
00:51:37 okay and in here you should have
00:51:41 a little um flosser buddy that's got two
00:51:45 different kinds
00:51:46 of thread on it and a needle in it okay
00:51:48 so for folks at home just
00:51:50 if if you don't want to rip this one if
00:51:51 they're darning something
00:51:53 at home feel free to grab any garment
00:51:55 right now yeah yeah if you have a whole
00:51:56 pair of socks or anything we're going to
00:51:58 learn how to do this right totally
00:52:00 cool yeah and we i mean i only gave you
00:52:02 a yard of the each of the threads
00:52:04 so um if it's a really big hole i would
00:52:07 say maybe
00:52:08 maybe find some thread what's the
00:52:09 difference between the two threads okay
00:52:11 okay yeah so that's a
00:52:12 big deal so i we're gonna start with the
00:52:14 orange thread you're gonna take that off
00:52:16 this is called this is a braided waxed
00:52:19 thread
00:52:19 so as john told you all about the
00:52:22 wonderful properties of
00:52:23 waxing it keeps you know the thread
00:52:27 slick it keeps it easy to use and it
00:52:29 strengthens the thread it is also
00:52:31 braided which is something that is
00:52:33 very high quality as well which if you
00:52:35 look really closely at it you can see
00:52:36 um that the whole thing has been kind of
00:52:39 braided into a tube
00:52:40 which means it's going to be a lot
00:52:42 harder for it to unravel much most
00:52:43 thread is just um
00:52:44 spun around you were saying earlier when
00:52:46 you go hiking or camping
00:52:48 you throw a similar kit just in your
00:52:51 like first aid kit
00:52:52 like let's have a little clothing first
00:52:54 date or tent first date yeah
00:52:55 yeah and where where would i buy this
00:52:57 thread um
00:52:59 i believe uh i know mcpherson's who
00:53:02 sells us our um some of our leather
00:53:05 supplies leather working supplies
00:53:07 um they have it um or just the internet
00:53:09 the magic of the internet
00:53:11 this is tiger brand thread they're
00:53:13 really high quality you can get a little
00:53:15 bit or a lot of it
00:53:16 and we use it for all of our
00:53:19 hand stitching that we do with our
00:53:20 leather goods in the workshop we do a
00:53:22 lot of
00:53:22 um small leather goods so this is tiger
00:53:25 branded
00:53:26 waxed braided thread yep okay
00:53:29 yes and it comes i believe the
00:53:30 manufacturers are in germany and do i
00:53:32 thread the needle
00:53:33 yes so step one thread the needle we
00:53:35 gave you a really nice
00:53:36 big needle with a big eye which makes
00:53:38 everything easier
00:53:39 so you're just gonna pop that through
00:53:41 pretty simple
00:53:42 another nice thing about the wax thread
00:53:44 it's not going to fray and unravel on
00:53:46 you on the end so it usually is pretty
00:53:48 easy to get it through your needle
00:53:51 then for this one the beauty of the
00:53:54 braided one
00:53:55 the braided thread is that instead of
00:53:57 trying to tie a knot or try to keep this
00:53:59 in place if anybody's done hand sewing
00:54:01 before trying to keep your little tail
00:54:02 together is kind of hard
00:54:04 so what you're going to do is you're
00:54:06 going to go to the long end
00:54:08 um and you're gonna pass
00:54:11 hold on sorry um you're gonna pass your
00:54:15 needle through it
00:54:16 um in order to create a little lock
00:54:20 on it okay hold on you are stabbing
00:54:24 the long line with the needle
00:54:27 and you're pushing the the needle
00:54:29 through the thread
00:54:31 and pulling it through yeah and that's
00:54:33 going to lock it in place for you
00:54:34 so that no way it doesn't go anywhere
00:54:37 yeah yeah that's so cool
00:54:39 yeah so it keeps it in place while
00:54:41 you're sewing which is awesome
00:54:42 i hope everyone at home saw that you
00:54:44 just you just take the needle and you
00:54:46 stab the thread and pull it through
00:54:48 yep and it should stay in place okay
00:54:50 yeah all right um
00:54:52 okay so you got one that you got a hole
00:54:54 it goes all the way to the end
00:54:56 i'm in bad shape over here we're gonna
00:54:57 start at that and then because
00:54:59 you are you're gonna want to keep that
00:55:01 in line with
00:55:02 itself if that makes sense got it i'll
00:55:05 start at the
00:55:06 okay okay so we're doing what's called a
00:55:09 whip stitch it's very it's pretty
00:55:10 straightforward
00:55:11 um it's kind of going end over end
00:55:14 if anybody's done that before rather
00:55:16 than like straight through
00:55:18 okay so we're gonna kind of wrap the raw
00:55:19 edge of the fabric here that you have
00:55:22 um with your thread um
00:55:25 so first you're going to want to fold it
00:55:28 so that your
00:55:28 raw edges are lined up so this is what
00:55:31 it looks like
00:55:32 you're working on the outside of the
00:55:33 garment or the inside of the garment it
00:55:35 depends on how you want it to look
00:55:36 so if you want to be able to see your
00:55:37 stitching you want the outside to be
00:55:40 sticking up if you don't want to see
00:55:41 your stitching
00:55:42 you want the outside um you want i want
00:55:45 it
00:55:45 to be because you want to see
00:55:48 i think so absolutely okay yeah well and
00:55:50 that's why we gave you the beautiful
00:55:52 orange thread yeah all right in the
00:55:54 field you would probably have the
00:55:55 garment
00:55:56 okay yeah you also might have the
00:55:58 garment on oh yeah you can't hear jeremy
00:56:00 at home but
00:56:01 in the field you might even be wearing
00:56:03 this thing because it's cold and you can
00:56:04 just
00:56:05 do it right here yep totally yes so what
00:56:08 you're going to do is you're just going
00:56:09 to stab through both layers
00:56:10 okay try to keep your end lined up just
00:56:12 so that everything kind of stays in the
00:56:14 place that it was
00:56:15 now the hard thing about this big needle
00:56:17 is that it's harder to
00:56:19 shove through the fabric yeah but you
00:56:21 can do it
00:56:22 i just pulled mine all the way through
00:56:23 yeah so
00:56:25 try it again you're going to want to
00:56:28 pull through but you're going to want
00:56:30 to stop and you want to you're going to
00:56:31 want to give yourself a couple inches at
00:56:33 the end there
00:56:34 okay just leave it where it is okay done
00:56:36 okay and now
00:56:37 we're going to do that fun little trick
00:56:38 where we go back around
00:56:40 so i've got it like this that's my end
00:56:42 and this is my raw edge that i'm trying
00:56:44 to stitch up and sew
00:56:45 i'm going to come back around here and
00:56:47 i'm going to stab through that end again
00:56:49 of the
00:56:49 oh you're going to stab through the tail
00:56:53 this is another cool thing about the
00:56:54 braided thread is it's sort of a quick
00:56:56 built-in knotting technique that you
00:56:58 would otherwise have to be
00:57:00 making a little knot for yourself it
00:57:02 just saves you a lot of heartache
00:57:04 to be able to do that so tighten it down
00:57:08 you got that and then if you want and i
00:57:11 would suggest this
00:57:12 you just tie an extra little knot on it
00:57:14 to keep it safe
00:57:17 use my little tail tie one more knot
00:57:19 just one little knot yeah just a regular
00:57:22 a regular old knot yeah
00:57:25 okay so we stabbed again through the
00:57:27 tail
00:57:28 tied a knot tied a knot so you got your
00:57:31 anchor
00:57:31 your you got your base i got my set now
00:57:34 you're just going to keep your two sides
00:57:36 together
00:57:36 keep it folded keep it folded
00:57:40 that's okay is if you're if your
00:57:42 thread's anchored that's all that
00:57:43 matters
00:57:44 so you can just you because you want
00:57:46 your thread to be anchored somewhere
00:57:48 in your garment right but it's okay if
00:57:50 it's only on one side or the other
00:57:51 sometimes
00:57:52 have you sewed something before it's
00:57:53 your first time i'm just i'm just
00:57:55 curious this is my first step
00:57:56 that's what i thought that's why we put
00:57:57 you on this class yeah yeah exactly
00:57:59 that's right
00:58:00 it's amazing to me how many people will
00:58:01 come in and ask if i can
00:58:03 i just have friends who ask if i can sew
00:58:05 a button on for them and i just think
00:58:06 man you never looked
00:58:08 that's why we're here tonight i feel
00:58:09 like it doesn't get taught a whole lot
00:58:10 anymore not anymore
00:58:11 bringing that back yeah i think the year
00:58:13 after i took home back in
00:58:15 in middle school they canceled the class
00:58:16 so i i caught it right at it
00:58:19 okay next so once you have them together
00:58:21 you're going to stab through both layers
00:58:23 again
00:58:24 okay and i with this size thread and
00:58:27 with this size hole
00:58:28 i'm going to paste it about a quarter
00:58:30 inch apart and about
00:58:32 a quarter inch to an eighth away from
00:58:34 the edge of that raw edge it's kind of
00:58:35 hard to pull the needle
00:58:36 totally that's so the ratios you know
00:58:39 you can get most sewing kits that you'll
00:58:41 find at the store have a really small
00:58:42 needle
00:58:43 with a really small eye which means it's
00:58:44 harder to thread your needle right but
00:58:46 it's probably easier to get it through
00:58:47 some stuff
00:58:48 harder to get through thicker stuff if
00:58:50 it's a thin needle do i always
00:58:52 push the needle through the same side
00:58:54 each time yes so that's what makes this
00:58:56 a whip stitch is that we're going to go
00:58:58 through
00:59:00 and we're going so we came out the top
00:59:02 right and we're going to go
00:59:04 back around to the bottom and pop back
00:59:06 out the top again
00:59:07 okay so you're just going kind of like
00:59:09 you're circling
00:59:11 you're winding spiraling your way down
00:59:12 and you call that whip stitch
00:59:14 it's just called a whip stitch there's
00:59:16 some advantage to whip stitch
00:59:18 um it's pretty quick it
00:59:22 is i think makes the most ergonomic
00:59:26 sense in a lot of ways
00:59:27 it definitely secures the fact that you
00:59:29 have you know your two layers sandwiched
00:59:31 together if you were doing
00:59:33 what's called a running stitch um
00:59:36 you're trying to do like a straight
00:59:37 stitch and it just is not quite as
00:59:39 stable
00:59:40 okay if if i pull it too tight the
00:59:42 fabric goes
00:59:44 and that's okay i would recommend trying
00:59:46 to keep it about
00:59:47 at um you know like you can kind of see
00:59:49 on mine here it got kind of tight
00:59:52 um up on the edge of the fray but this
00:59:54 is this is all
00:59:56 stuff that is not really functional
00:59:58 fabric anymore right like some of the
01:00:00 yarns came out and this is just
01:00:02 little little um threads that are
01:00:04 hanging
01:00:05 and so you don't want to get too close
01:00:07 to that because then your thread can rip
01:00:09 back out of that
01:00:09 right it's not strong yeah so you want
01:00:11 to stay far enough away that you've
01:00:13 still got
01:00:14 you know four or five threads between
01:00:16 you and the edge and the needle
01:00:18 okay just keep it strong and then i'm
01:00:20 gonna go on a limb here yeah
01:00:22 let's say i cut my arm open
01:00:26 and but in my first aid kit because you
01:00:28 had me prepared i have
01:00:30 my needle in my thread would this
01:00:33 would this work um yes
01:00:38 with the strong caveat of you're gonna
01:00:40 need to make sure it's sterile
01:00:42 and i would just hold up a lighter to
01:00:43 the needle right uh yes but i would be
01:00:45 more worried about the thread being
01:00:47 sterile it's really
01:00:48 hard to sterilize cotton because you
01:00:49 can't if you light the cotton on fire
01:00:51 it's gone okay but if i'm like gushing
01:00:53 blood i might not really yeah run it
01:00:55 through some if you have rubbing alcohol
01:00:57 or something just
01:00:58 antiseptic something vodka whatever you
01:01:00 got and this this
01:01:01 exact stitch will work to sew up my
01:01:04 wound
01:01:04 yeah yeah that's my understanding but
01:01:06 once again i am not a medical
01:01:07 professional
01:01:08 that's awesome yeah um
01:01:12 yeah i mean it's kind of the same
01:01:13 principle wound is underneath the rip in
01:01:15 your
01:01:15 you know in your shirt you can just just
01:01:17 do it all in one dude
01:01:19 tiger wax thread that stuff off
01:01:22 not a medical yes a whip stitch
01:01:26 works uh to sew skin
01:01:30 yeah that's insane yeah it's i mean it's
01:01:32 pretty ancient technology right
01:01:35 we've managed to now now i feel like
01:01:38 everybody gets
01:01:38 their their scars super glued shut but
01:01:41 it is still something that people are
01:01:42 using
01:01:43 yeah you can also use duct tape right
01:01:46 yeah
01:01:48 that is that's the other thing that's
01:01:49 always important
01:01:51 when i go camping yeah always a roll
01:01:54 here's the thing though is if you're
01:01:55 using this wax
01:01:56 if you have something that's waxed you
01:01:57 can't put duct tape on it the adhesive's
01:01:59 not going to stick to that duct tape so
01:02:00 you're going to have to sew it back
01:02:02 together
01:02:02 got it yeah
01:02:06 yes indeed so yep you can do this all
01:02:10 the way to the other end
01:02:11 basically as long as that takes you
01:02:14 no it's cool that you just keep it
01:02:16 folded it makes it a lot easier
01:02:19 and of course you know you have it
01:02:20 folded so there are a couple of ways you
01:02:22 can kind of
01:02:23 finish it out where you can get it to
01:02:25 lay a little bit differently
01:02:27 but um essentially you can kind of see
01:02:29 once you start pulling it those
01:02:31 that quarter inch on either side of that
01:02:33 tear has now been kind of taken out of
01:02:34 the center of the fabric so it is going
01:02:36 to
01:02:37 shrink it down a little bit it's going
01:02:38 to change the shape right
01:02:40 because it's just not laying flat if you
01:02:42 want it to lay perfectly flat
01:02:43 you would have to get a patch or
01:02:46 something to slide behind it and then
01:02:48 attach the patch to the back of it to
01:02:50 keep it totally level
01:02:52 but this is the down and dirty fastest
01:02:54 version
01:02:55 of keeping your stuff functional out in
01:02:58 the middle
01:02:59 of your hunting trip or wherever you
01:03:00 make okay so when i'm at the end
01:03:03 yes uh how do i how do i finish very
01:03:05 similar to the way you started
01:03:07 so another hot tip too if you're having
01:03:10 trouble getting it through
01:03:11 the end i always just like to kind of
01:03:13 push it onto the table
01:03:15 that sometimes helps the needle go
01:03:16 through if it's not
01:03:18 oh because it is hard to push through
01:03:20 this tin cloth
01:03:21 that's what thimbles are for frequently
01:03:24 is they're either to protect the thumb
01:03:25 on the exit side so you're not poking
01:03:27 through
01:03:28 or or i use it to push it through
01:03:31 which might not be the correct way but
01:03:33 so i'm gonna i'm gonna go through and
01:03:35 then i'm gonna just poke it through
01:03:37 and tie a knot yeah yeah so i'm i'm not
01:03:39 all the way down with my holes
01:03:41 but you can just get to the end i would
01:03:43 go like one
01:03:44 continuous circle so maybe go back
01:03:46 through the hole that you
01:03:48 just did again so that it's
01:03:52 one big loop and then
01:03:58 you can stab through that loop that you
01:04:02 just made
01:04:02 the braided part of the thread there and
01:04:05 pull that
01:04:07 through that's going to anchor it a
01:04:08 little bit
01:04:10 and then tie a quick little
01:04:14 knot into the thread if that makes sense
01:04:20 oh you went back to a previous stitch
01:04:22 and just tied another anchor
01:04:24 so notice you didn't clean up the the
01:04:26 rip at all
01:04:27 do you do that after the fact or does
01:04:29 that even matter you can as you go i
01:04:31 mean depending on how fast you're going
01:04:34 or how bad the rip is it does sometimes
01:04:36 help to get rid of some of that stuff
01:04:38 because it will um
01:04:40 it can contribute to the fraying yeah if
01:04:43 you have the stuff
01:04:44 but also once you start pulling it out i
01:04:46 mean then it's just gone and it's okay
01:04:47 and then i just cut it wasn't functional
01:04:49 anyways
01:04:50 um yeah you just cut the end of it
01:04:54 let's test it yeah i mean it's like rock
01:04:56 solid yeah it's rocks can't pull it
01:04:58 apart that's kind of what the back looks
01:04:59 like
01:05:01 oh yeah that does look better on the
01:05:02 other side yeah so that's if you
01:05:04 if you don't want it to be visible right
01:05:07 that's
01:05:08 you're going to want to do you know the
01:05:09 reverse of what we did basically do all
01:05:11 this stuff on the inside of your garment
01:05:12 rather than on outside
01:05:14 okay we only have just a few minutes
01:05:16 left okay
01:05:17 talk to us about doing this material
01:05:19 okay this is for our button so in your
01:05:21 little packet
01:05:22 there should also be a button
01:05:26 um these guys and then of course you're
01:05:30 going to need the rest of the thread
01:05:31 that was left on
01:05:32 same needle same needle we're using the
01:05:34 same needle these are big buttons
01:05:36 so um and pretty sturdy cloth so we can
01:05:38 use the same big needle
01:05:40 and you're just going to unwind this
01:05:41 whole thing in general if you're doing
01:05:44 if you're sewing something
01:05:45 with more delicate cloth you'd use a
01:05:47 thinner needle so you're making smaller
01:05:49 holes
01:05:49 totally yep yep absolutely yeah the
01:05:52 smaller the cloth
01:05:53 or the more delicate the glass the
01:05:55 smaller the yarns in the cloth is what
01:05:56 you call the threads that actually make
01:05:58 up the weave of the fabric
01:06:00 the the smaller those are usually the
01:06:02 smaller the needle you're going to want
01:06:02 to use um
01:06:05 so you're going to double it
01:06:08 instead of just doing pull it all the
01:06:10 way through pull it all the way through
01:06:11 so you got two
01:06:12 same length and then you can tie it in a
01:06:14 knot if you want at the end
01:06:16 to keep it at the same length but you
01:06:18 don't have to do that
01:06:19 because i'm going to show you a
01:06:20 different way to avoid knotting because
01:06:22 knotting can
01:06:23 actually be the worst part of sewing
01:06:25 sometimes
01:06:26 i'm not going to do it okay so pick
01:06:29 wherever you want to put this button on
01:06:30 here
01:06:32 and we're going to start from the back
01:06:35 side
01:06:36 which doesn't really matter in this case
01:06:38 but you start from the back
01:06:42 pull it through i had a knot there which
01:06:45 just kept me from
01:06:46 going all the way through i thought we
01:06:47 weren't adding knots you don't have to i
01:06:49 did
01:06:50 you don't have to well i want to do what
01:06:51 you're doing
01:06:53 it's just i mean like you know how you
01:06:54 pull your thread through earlier on this
01:06:56 one
01:06:56 yeah that just stops it from from going
01:06:59 all the way through
01:07:00 okay hold on but it's not a big deal
01:07:03 i need all the help i can get okay
01:07:07 okay so i have my knot yeah doubled and
01:07:10 you want you're not on your back end
01:07:12 okay and so then this is the front right
01:07:15 no knot nice and clean it's like
01:07:17 roulette you keep stabbing it until it
01:07:19 finds it yeah and this is something
01:07:21 you'll you get better with the time too
01:07:23 you kind of like feel around
01:07:24 i basically put my finger right behind
01:07:26 every single time i sew which means that
01:07:28 i
01:07:29 stab my finger a lot but i've learned
01:07:30 the correct amount of pressure so i
01:07:32 usually don't make myself bleed
01:07:35 it comes with time so you're going to do
01:07:38 an anchor stitch which is basically what
01:07:39 we did at the beginning of that one
01:07:41 minus the pulling through the braided
01:07:42 part
01:07:43 so you're just gonna go around the same
01:07:46 two holes
01:07:47 a couple of times hold on so so i came
01:07:50 up through the bottom
01:07:51 okay oh you already put your we don't
01:07:53 need the button yet oh
01:07:56 we gotta anchor our fabric in place
01:07:58 sorry or our thread in place and we're
01:08:00 just gonna do one quick
01:08:01 anchor stitch you can do it if you don't
01:08:02 have a knot i would recommend going
01:08:04 around three times otherwise you can
01:08:05 just do it once
01:08:07 i always do the button right away so
01:08:08 you're just creating an anchor we're
01:08:09 just creating an anchor so this is the
01:08:11 stable
01:08:12 stable base you've got to create a
01:08:14 question around the thickness of the
01:08:15 thread you don't by chance
01:08:17 no the the uh the diameter of the thread
01:08:20 so the one that we gave you guys the one
01:08:21 that we're using is
01:08:22 a text 60 tex is like the
01:08:25 uh whatever you call that the
01:08:27 calibration um
01:08:29 for thread most home sewing stuff
01:08:32 quilting stuff is going to be more
01:08:33 towards 30 which is thinner
01:08:35 smaller diameter this is this is what we
01:08:38 use on all of our luggage and all of our
01:08:40 clothes here at filson so it's a little
01:08:41 fill some tough you guys you go sexy
01:08:44 okay i am anchored okay you're anchored
01:08:46 so are you you're on your right side do
01:08:48 you have your
01:08:49 thread out on the right side of your
01:08:50 fabric on the button side on the button
01:08:52 side yes
01:08:52 okay yeah you can just go right back up
01:08:54 through that same hole i'm on the button
01:08:56 side
01:08:56 okay so we've already created two holes
01:08:58 basically right we've got this little
01:09:00 loop here we have two holes
01:09:02 and we're only gonna really make two
01:09:03 more while we're doing this
01:09:06 okay does that make sense that's not
01:09:08 what i did
01:09:10 well kind of is what i did yeah okay it
01:09:12 just kind of looks like a little bar
01:09:14 just a little yeah there's a little
01:09:15 anchor spot and then the thread
01:09:17 yeah and periodically you're going to
01:09:19 want to check the back just to make sure
01:09:21 your thread's not getting out of control
01:09:22 and looping out on you because sometimes
01:09:24 that will happen and that's very
01:09:25 frustrating okay yeah so now you're
01:09:27 going to put
01:09:29 your button on thread the button
01:09:34 okay and i like to do a little cross
01:09:36 hatch when i'm doing my buttons
01:09:38 you could also do a bar technique um but
01:09:42 we're going to do cross hatch today
01:09:43 so i'm going to go diagonal you're going
01:09:45 to go diagonal so you're going to
01:09:46 bottom or i'm doing bottom right up to
01:09:49 top left
01:09:50 okay and i just put it just through the
01:09:51 button first and then
01:09:53 we're basically gonna make a little
01:09:55 square that mimics where these four
01:09:59 holes are here oh so right up here
01:10:01 through the button
01:10:02 i take i move the button to this i don't
01:10:06 care about the button and i go to a
01:10:08 spot that's just real close oh no you
01:10:10 want to you want to go through the
01:10:11 button
01:10:11 no i'm through the button okay yeah so
01:10:13 then you go diagonal find your diagonal
01:10:15 hole find my diagonal hole yeah
01:10:17 yeah yeah and then find it just because
01:10:19 it's hard to poke around when you got
01:10:20 your button really close up to your
01:10:21 fabric
01:10:22 and figure out what's going on back
01:10:23 there so that's all that is it's just
01:10:25 kind of giving yourself a little bit of
01:10:26 slack and a little bit of room
01:10:28 so we've gone diagonal so we're gonna
01:10:30 make basically mimic that
01:10:33 the shape right so i came up through
01:10:35 there and went down through there
01:10:37 so my thread should be there and then
01:10:38 going down through there yep
01:10:40 okay so we're gonna pull that through
01:10:45 and we're gonna you can you can refine
01:10:47 it make it really tight
01:10:49 or you can give it a little bit of slack
01:10:52 and we want to give it just a little bit
01:10:53 of slack and a little bit of movement
01:10:55 because if you imagine you're trying to
01:10:57 get a wool
01:10:58 jacket around this i hate when the
01:11:01 buttons are too tight
01:11:02 yeah exactly button it if the button is
01:11:05 like so flush into the so you
01:11:07 you just give it a little bit of give it
01:11:08 a little bit of give yeah so
01:11:10 if you can look at your button you want
01:11:12 to be able to see some
01:11:13 sky between the button and the the wall
01:11:17 when you're sewing that is there a term
01:11:19 for that space is there like a
01:11:20 button sewing or something like that no
01:11:24 would you like to coin it tonight would
01:11:26 you like to just say
01:11:27 you know that i that this is like
01:11:31 the cover the hover era area i don't
01:11:34 know
01:11:35 and then and then i just keep using the
01:11:37 same holes yeah okay so
01:11:39 yeah so you went across and now you can
01:11:41 go back in that first hole that you made
01:11:44 right because you look on the back and
01:11:45 you see where your holes are
01:11:47 yep exactly so yeah so i went back
01:11:50 through that same hole there
01:11:51 that i had started with pull through and
01:11:54 now you can do this too with your
01:11:56 your thread just a single ply you don't
01:11:58 have to double it up but
01:11:59 it goes twice as fast if you double up
01:12:01 your thread so
01:12:03 um and then so i came out there i'm
01:12:05 going to go back down there
01:12:07 and now that it's a little bit tighter
01:12:08 i'm or i want it to be a little bit
01:12:10 tighter now that i'm getting into the
01:12:12 point where it's it needs to be however
01:12:15 tight it's going to be
01:12:16 i'm going to just pull on it a little
01:12:17 bit
01:12:19 and then on the back there i should i
01:12:21 should basically have a little grid
01:12:22 happening and
01:12:23 how many total passes passes
01:12:27 do you do on a button i usually do three
01:12:30 um but it's totally up to you what you
01:12:33 think
01:12:34 is the right amount you can't do too
01:12:35 many you can't do too many
01:12:37 um you will run out of thread
01:12:40 eventually which um we gave you about
01:12:43 enough to do three
01:12:44 is what we calculated about so
01:12:47 i would do about three times around
01:12:50 you're just gonna go yep in and out of
01:12:52 all those same holes
01:12:54 and you'll notice so if you have a
01:12:55 crosshatch on the top you're gonna have
01:12:57 little bars on the back yeah um if you
01:12:59 wanna
01:13:00 do the bar technique you'd have a little
01:13:01 crosshatch on the back and the back of
01:13:03 mine doesn't look
01:13:05 maybe like you'd hope yeah so that's
01:13:07 what does the back look like
01:13:09 oh marissa i'm hearing it's called the
01:13:13 shank
01:13:14 the shank apparently there are some pros
01:13:16 on here yes
01:13:17 it's already been named yes yes we have
01:13:19 not created the shank part yet but we
01:13:21 will get there
01:13:22 okay this is so if you don't have super
01:13:24 thick fabric you could do this
01:13:25 really uptight close and that'd be fine
01:13:28 um
01:13:29 or you can do the shank method where you
01:13:31 get it really
01:13:33 nice and tight or you float it out a
01:13:35 little bit okay
01:13:36 yeah this feels good okay so how do i
01:13:38 finish it okay so once you got your
01:13:40 three
01:13:41 put on there or your three times around
01:13:45 so for the last one this is my last pass
01:13:48 on this one i'm going to put the needle
01:13:50 between the the button
01:13:52 and the fabric they're not going all the
01:13:55 way through not going all the way
01:13:56 through
01:13:56 okay and then this is the part where
01:13:59 you're gonna create your shank
01:14:01 make sure you still have a little bit of
01:14:02 give there give a little test
01:14:04 see if you can see some sky and then
01:14:07 you're just gonna
01:14:08 you're gonna hold it you're gonna hold
01:14:10 this part really tight
01:14:11 the fabric really tight and then you're
01:14:14 going to
01:14:14 wrap your thread around it
01:14:18 good three times four times as many
01:14:22 times as you want really
01:14:23 i've done something terrible hold on
01:14:37 i made a mistake and
01:14:40 uh i don't know if it's coverable uh
01:14:43 it probably is so you you can back
01:14:46 yourself out of any situation
01:14:49 usually i mean you have to be you get
01:14:51 better at this this one's pretty bad
01:14:53 so yeah you can back yourself out by
01:14:55 okay just passing your
01:14:56 your needle back through the hole that
01:14:58 it went through if you can do that
01:15:00 but i hear you hold on we're just gonna
01:15:03 don't look we're just gonna
01:15:08 um so the shank
01:15:12 you take it through and you wrap it
01:15:13 around you wrap it around
01:15:15 give it a good three spins i'd say okay
01:15:18 and then
01:15:19 do a knot version of the same thing so
01:15:21 you're gonna
01:15:22 go around but instead of just wrapping
01:15:24 it you're gonna pass your needle through
01:15:27 right finish it got it and then that
01:15:29 creates a knot
01:15:30 you do that a couple times i would do
01:15:32 three of each once again
01:15:34 three knots as strong as you feel this
01:15:37 part
01:15:37 is sometimes very satisfying confused
01:15:40 huh
01:15:40 yeah i mean this is already going to be
01:15:43 way stronger than almost any button sewn
01:15:45 onto any garment you get because
01:15:46 almost that's saying a lot when you're
01:15:48 in the philton headquarters yeah well
01:15:50 almost all buttons are now put on by
01:15:51 machines and so they do a quick little
01:15:53 machine thing but there's i mean we've
01:15:55 already put way more effort
01:15:57 and work into it exactly they're running
01:15:59 me out of a job
01:16:00 so um and the way you can finish this
01:16:03 instead of having to try another knot
01:16:05 is you literally stab through the center
01:16:08 of your shank through the shank
01:16:09 through the shank you stab it and if
01:16:11 you've done your shank correctly it
01:16:12 should be kind of tight and hard to get
01:16:14 through
01:16:14 okay and then this is the part where i
01:16:15 like to use the table to just
01:16:17 push it all the way through and then
01:16:21 and then you've got a little hidden tail
01:16:23 you you clip it as close up as you can
01:16:26 and then you don't have an anything left
01:16:28 and then you can cut
01:16:29 the back there you've got a clean
01:16:33 let's just for comparison
01:16:36 this is the let's just look at the two
01:16:39 buttons
01:16:41 um don't quit your night job yes well
01:16:43 this
01:16:44 i mean it chances are you just you jus
01:16:46 something just got a little tangled up
01:16:48 back there and it's it is recovering i
01:16:50 mean the people
01:16:50 at home told me to drink more beer
01:16:54 got sewed on and in a field repair i
01:16:56 feel like he just buttoned up that
01:16:58 mackinaw jacket and
01:16:59 a field repair my buttons gonna stay on
01:17:01 absolutely it is
01:17:02 yeah they might not there's no hope no
01:17:04 it's okay
01:17:05 it's it's a lost cause but but this is
