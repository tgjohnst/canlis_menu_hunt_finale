00:01:39 found questions to get through
00:01:41 let's get through some of the curriculum
00:01:43 first students let's get it through
00:01:45 okay let's start let's start with kxp
00:01:47 okay because
00:01:48 not only is it maybe my favorite place
00:01:50 to go just get a coffee and hang out
00:01:51 listen to music
00:01:53 but it is arguably the world's most
00:01:55 famous
00:01:56 and beloved radio station is that a too
00:01:59 strong
00:02:01 of a statement i'm very passionate about
00:02:03 kxp so i like to shoot for the moon and
00:02:05 say that we are the most beloved
00:02:07 most well-known radio station in the
00:02:09 world in the world
00:02:10 i would say that i mean you countries
00:02:13 you have listeners from all over the
00:02:16 world who tune into your show
00:02:17 who text you who call like and you have
00:02:19 bumper stickers all over the world it's
00:02:21 it's
00:02:22 it's a radio station that transcend that
00:02:24 transcends
00:02:25 geographic boundary yeah so not only the
00:02:28 radio broadcast but
00:02:29 also our youtube channel of our our live
00:02:31 performance videos that's really where
00:02:33 we're getting
00:02:34 most of the the worldwide audience
00:02:38 people are oh i i'm thinking of a band
00:02:40 i'm typing it into youtube
00:02:42 and chances are they've come through kxp
00:02:44 or we've come to them and filmed them
00:02:47 and so that's how that's the gateway for
00:02:49 for most people around the world to
00:02:51 discover kxp is through our youtube
00:02:53 channel
00:02:53 and kxp is what it is today i think it's
00:02:56 worth
00:02:57 shouting it out a lot because the
00:02:58 generosity of
00:03:00 paul allen i mean you guys started at uw
00:03:03 yeah so the history of kxp
00:03:04 i think is really interesting we started
00:03:07 in 1972 so we're approaching our 50th
00:03:09 anniversary
00:03:10 in a couple years which is really weird
00:03:12 trippy but also very very cool
00:03:14 um so it started out as a tiny
00:03:16 student-run radio station
00:03:18 at the university of washington our call
00:03:19 letters used to be kcmu
00:03:21 we used to be literally 10 watts so you
00:03:23 could only get it in the university
00:03:25 district like just a few blocks
00:03:27 if you yeah if you drove outside the
00:03:29 university district
00:03:30 you can't get it anymore so um
00:03:33 sometime around 1999 or so the
00:03:36 university of washington decided that
00:03:38 um because they hold the npr affiliate
00:03:41 license as well kow okay so they decided
00:03:44 they didn't want to have two radio
00:03:45 frequencies
00:03:46 so um paul allen was a fan of kcmu
00:03:50 and didn't want it to go away so he was
00:03:52 very instrumental in helping us become
00:03:54 independent so he helped us with
00:03:58 funding to get up and running basically
00:04:01 for the first three years he also
00:04:03 helped us get our first building our old
00:04:05 home yeah at dexter in denver
00:04:07 um and with with the intention that um
00:04:10 over
00:04:10 that period of time we would become
00:04:13 completely independent
00:04:14 and that's what we are today so we're
00:04:15 listener powered we have fundraising
00:04:17 drives
00:04:17 we do business support so businesses can
00:04:19 support khp
00:04:21 were you there the night that camelos
00:04:23 opened
00:04:24 a dive bar inside kxp when was that
00:04:27 workman was like two years ago
00:04:29 like two years ago two three years ago
00:04:31 we
00:04:32 we created we had a bathtub on a on a
00:04:34 pickup truck
00:04:35 full of beer what the hell and we had
00:04:37 like horseshoes
00:04:38 and bonfires it was like you know we did
00:04:41 it when she was off
00:04:42 apparently they did but it was so fun it
00:04:44 was for the the power
00:04:46 uh listeners uh supporters of kxp yeah
00:04:48 the amplifiers yeah amplifiers
00:04:50 yeah so if you become an infant player
00:04:52 at kxp
00:04:53 sometimes you get invited that's right
00:04:56 and sometimes camelot gets to throw them
00:04:57 okay so that that's probably what
00:04:59 happened it was probably at night
00:05:00 it was it was at night yeah yeah you
00:05:02 live in bremerton
00:05:03 i live in birmingham which is just a
00:05:05 short ferry away you know just a couple
00:05:07 hours thanks for coming
00:05:08 all this way i know you've been working
00:05:10 from home as a dj yeah and it's not a
00:05:12 big it's a big deal for you to come
00:05:14 out of bremerton you know i mean you
00:05:16 come on saturdays for your show
00:05:17 yeah i come on saturdays for my show
00:05:18 it's funny because i was like whoa leave
00:05:20 my house and i was like oh actually
00:05:22 i never leave my house this is really
00:05:24 fun so thank you for having me so glad
00:05:26 you're here let's let's dive into some
00:05:27 history
00:05:28 okay seattle is a music town period i
00:05:31 mean people think of us
00:05:32 coffee airplanes computers and i think
00:05:34 music
00:05:35 yeah and maybe not in that order not
00:05:38 anymore
00:05:38 everyone thinks seattle they instantly
00:05:41 go to
00:05:42 to grunge right and the 90s right and
00:05:44 that's an important time
00:05:45 mm-hmm but they'd be wrong it is a
00:05:47 period of time
00:05:49 it's this much of our history can you
00:05:50 take us back to
00:05:53 before grunge what is the roots of
00:05:55 seattle music history
00:05:57 yeah totally so i think it's i think
00:05:59 it's really important to acknowledge
00:06:01 um that for hundreds of years
00:06:04 the native american tribe the duwamish
00:06:07 tribe were here
00:06:08 making music so that's part of the soul
00:06:09 of this city when
00:06:11 seattle started becoming occupied by
00:06:13 others
00:06:16 specifically in the 20th century that's
00:06:18 really where like the most
00:06:19 well-documented um modern music history
00:06:22 of seattle starts
00:06:24 and it's actually very rooted in the
00:06:27 central district the black community
00:06:30 has a huge huge huge influence on
00:06:33 seattle music history
00:06:34 so um rooting all the way back to 1918
00:06:38 is a
00:06:38 is one of the first recorded instances
00:06:40 of a jazz band playing at washington
00:06:43 hall
00:06:43 which is one of seattle's oldest most
00:06:45 beautiful
00:06:46 buildings and venues love that space so
00:06:48 much amazing
00:06:50 i've never been yeah it's oh you should
00:06:52 go it's a historic theater it's so cool
00:06:54 it's in it's in the
00:06:55 central district um so a jazz band
00:06:59 played there in 1918 for a naacp
00:07:02 fundraiser
00:07:04 and it sparked a jazz movement in
00:07:07 seattle which is super cool so
00:07:09 a lot of the the immigrant migrant
00:07:12 populations were
00:07:13 settling around the yesler terrace
00:07:15 central district area
00:07:17 um because in the 1800s a lot of the
00:07:20 european
00:07:22 settlers were rich people who were like
00:07:25 timber barons
00:07:26 you have your yesler you have your denny
00:07:28 you have your big seattle name
00:07:30 the the rich white people right yeah um
00:07:32 so they
00:07:33 established these victorian homes and
00:07:35 after a while moved on from them so
00:07:37 there were these remnants of hotels and
00:07:40 bars and things like that
00:07:41 and um they were more abandoned so they
00:07:44 were
00:07:45 more affordable to live and they were
00:07:46 cheaper to live in
00:07:48 so people were settling in that area so
00:07:50 that's that's really where a lot of that
00:07:52 established and i think this is so
00:07:53 interesting so
00:07:54 um it's so weird to think that 100 years
00:07:57 ago
00:07:58 there was prohibition in america when
00:07:59 we're sitting here having a cocktail
00:08:01 right now
00:08:01 right so um prohibition was going on at
00:08:04 the time and
00:08:04 and on jackson street in the central
00:08:07 district
00:08:09 um all of these speakeasies
00:08:12 started popping up these clubs and
00:08:16 luckily for us in our in our music
00:08:18 history the
00:08:19 the government officials were like yeah
00:08:22 you can pay me some bricks
00:08:24 was in seattle a little more like you
00:08:27 know prohibition
00:08:28 you know we're we're off the beaten
00:08:30 track as yeah that's like an east coast
00:08:32 thing
00:08:32 yeah we're far away right so the
00:08:34 government officials were like yeah you
00:08:36 can grease the palms and you can
00:08:37 you can have your clubs so um they were
00:08:41 they were left alone fairly well for a
00:08:45 couple decades
00:08:46 so it it had time to
00:08:49 flourish and establish in a community
00:08:51 form so while other cities
00:08:53 their club scene stalled or stayed
00:08:56 broken up or yeah you know ours had this
00:08:59 chance to like really dig in
00:09:00 yeah and build this foundation of
00:09:02 seattle music during prohibition
00:09:05 yeah so all of these clubs started
00:09:07 popping up on jackson it's called
00:09:09 the jackson street circuit and um all
00:09:12 these jazz musicians would
00:09:13 jam together and play there and and
00:09:16 seattle became
00:09:17 like a beacon of jazz music that was um
00:09:22 different than jazz around the country
00:09:24 you know
00:09:25 it wasn't the um kansas city sound it
00:09:28 wasn't the
00:09:29 chicago sound it wasn't the south
00:09:32 you know is there a ceo there was there
00:09:35 was a
00:09:36 seattle jazz sound um
00:09:39 so that's that's how it was during
00:09:41 prohibition and then when prohibition
00:09:43 lifted
00:09:45 um they actually started the police
00:09:47 started raiding
00:09:49 those places um
00:09:52 which is too bad uh but
00:09:55 in the 40s that's when a sort of a new
00:09:58 wave
00:09:58 of musicians came about and that's when
00:10:02 ray charles came to seattle no way when
00:10:04 quincy jones
00:10:06 um who moved here
00:10:09 with his family when he was quite young
00:10:11 his father remarried
00:10:13 um their his parents divorced his father
00:10:15 remarried he moved to bremerton
00:10:17 because his father got a job at the
00:10:19 shipyard
00:10:20 during the war so a lot of people ended
00:10:22 up coming to
00:10:24 the seattle area to work at the naval
00:10:26 shipyards
00:10:27 jones lived in bremerton yeah and that's
00:10:30 he
00:10:31 he says that bremerton is where he
00:10:34 um discovered his love of playing music
00:10:37 he
00:10:38 and his friends found this building and
00:10:41 they like broke in at night or something
00:10:43 and he saw a piano and he went up to it
00:10:45 and he started playing it and that was
00:10:46 like his
00:10:46 it was like electricity like love at
00:10:48 first sight i always heard a story that
00:10:50 quincy jones attended a ray charles
00:10:52 concert
00:10:53 in seattle yeah and that was like a big
00:10:56 moment for him
00:10:56 yeah so he says he says um so
00:11:00 here's the interesting thing about ray
00:11:01 charles so ray charles is from florida
00:11:03 he hated tampa he became orphaned when
00:11:07 he was very young
00:11:08 so when he was very young um the
00:11:11 the ages are weird like on the internet
00:11:14 there's a lot of discrepancy he was
00:11:15 either
00:11:16 15 16 17 18 when he picked up and was
00:11:20 like i need to leave florida and i want
00:11:22 to get
00:11:22 literally as far away from here as i
00:11:24 possibly can so he looked at a map and
00:11:26 he was like seattle
00:11:26 seattle and that's the reason he came
00:11:28 here and so he found
00:11:30 the community of the jackson street
00:11:32 circuit and was playing
00:11:34 there and people were like holy
00:11:37 you see this guy and he's blind too this
00:11:39 is nuts
00:11:40 wow so um quincy jones
00:11:43 uh only lived in bremerton for a short
00:11:46 time
00:11:47 moved to seattle he went to garfield
00:11:48 high school and he heard that there's
00:11:50 this blind man who is playing just this
00:11:52 wicked music
00:11:54 do you know what venues that ray charles
00:11:56 played in this city
00:11:58 um so it would have been it would have
00:12:01 been clubs
00:12:02 on jackson street that i think no longer
00:12:04 exist but i think
00:12:05 oh man don't quote me on this but i
00:12:07 think he played
00:12:08 the show box at the market all right
00:12:11 i'll quote you
00:12:12 yeah i think he did um quoted
00:12:15 uh so yeah quincy jones went saw him and
00:12:19 he met him
00:12:19 and they became friends and quincy
00:12:23 i believe played on ray charles first
00:12:25 record and he put out his first record
00:12:26 when he was here
00:12:27 so then um i also want to mention an
00:12:30 amazing
00:12:31 uh jazz singer who should have been as
00:12:33 famous probably as ella fitzgerald
00:12:35 billie holiday
00:12:36 um and that is ernestine anderson
00:12:40 who was in the 40s as well and she you
00:12:43 know
00:12:43 toured the world amazing jazz artist was
00:12:46 on quincy jones's label quest records
00:12:48 she joined that label in 93 because they
00:12:51 both went to garfield high school like
00:12:52 they all
00:12:53 roamed in the same circle isn't that
00:12:55 high school like known for producing
00:12:57 an insane talent yeah so it's really
00:13:00 cool because
00:13:00 during this time all of these people are
00:13:03 concentrated in this high school
00:13:05 who have this amazing love of music and
00:13:08 talent
00:13:09 raw talent and because of that there's
00:13:11 this
00:13:12 rich tradition of the high schools in
00:13:15 the seattle area
00:13:16 producing some of the most amazing high
00:13:19 school jazz bands
00:13:20 to this day even today they go to
00:13:21 competitions like
00:13:23 seattle area high schools win
00:13:26 all the time jazz music competition and
00:13:28 it's from this this like
00:13:30 rich shadow history of jazz music yeah
00:13:35 is that amazing yeah okay so how does
00:13:37 like
00:13:38 jimi hendrix come in or
00:13:41 who's who's next so jimi hendrix
00:13:43 actually didn't
00:13:44 live here a very long time when he was
00:13:46 19 he
00:13:48 um enrolled in the army because
00:13:50 otherwise
00:13:51 he probably would have been arrested for
00:13:53 because that was something
00:13:54 yeah but um he went to garfield for a
00:13:57 time
00:13:58 okay did not did not graduate left but
00:14:01 uh one funny thing about jimi hendrix
00:14:03 apparently when he was a kid he would
00:14:05 carry around a broom and pretend to play
00:14:07 guitar on it
00:14:08 and his like guidance counselor or
00:14:10 whatever at the school was like this
00:14:11 kid's weird
00:14:13 uh and told his parent his mom was like
00:14:16 you have to get him a guitar or i think
00:14:18 it's going to break him mentally he
00:14:19 really has to have
00:14:21 he would play the broom before he owned
00:14:22 a guitar yeah he'd carry around a broom
00:14:24 wow yeah so um so yeah that was
00:14:28 uh the 50s when jimi hendrix was around
00:14:32 this area
00:14:32 um but so coming into the 50s into the
00:14:36 60s
00:14:37 so this is where i think a lot of people
00:14:39 don't
00:14:40 know what the seattle music sound was
00:14:43 during this time you think oh yeah i've
00:14:44 heard ray charles i've heard quincy
00:14:46 jones of course
00:14:47 quincy jones is off doing his massive
00:14:50 career
00:14:51 at this time but you don't really think
00:14:53 about what happens until
00:14:55 grunge or right you know yeah like what
00:14:58 what was happening in the
00:14:59 60s and 70s yeah and 80s so seattle
00:15:02 actually
00:15:03 the seattle sound for decades
00:15:06 was funk and soul which a lot of people
00:15:09 don't know
00:15:10 and it's a lot of people who are coming
00:15:11 out of the music the music
00:15:13 uh department at garfield as well so i
00:15:16 used to work
00:15:17 um we're a funk and soul town we are a
00:15:19 fun consultant i didn't i didn't know
00:15:20 that about us
00:15:21 yeah i know see i don't feel personally
00:15:24 funky and soul-filled so this is
00:15:26 exciting
00:15:28 that's our identity as a city yeah it
00:15:30 really is
00:15:31 so um i used to work at local record
00:15:34 label light in the attic records
00:15:35 um lightning attic records has been
00:15:37 around for almost 20 years now
00:15:39 they're a reissue label so they dig and
00:15:42 they find
00:15:43 obscure things and they bring it to
00:15:44 light so that's what they think that's
00:15:46 all they do
00:15:47 that's all they do like i like light in
00:15:48 the attic yeah exactly okay
00:15:50 so um some of you may know
00:15:53 the documentary that won the oscar in
00:15:55 2012 searching for sugar man about the
00:15:58 artist rodriguez that oh yeah light in
00:16:00 the attic
00:16:00 i've seen that reissued cold fact yeah
00:16:02 rodriguez's album
00:16:04 um and then and then that documentary
00:16:06 went on to win the oscar so anyway
00:16:08 cool um lightning axe reissue label i
00:16:10 worked there for three years
00:16:11 and because of my time working there
00:16:13 that's how i really
00:16:14 found out about what was going on in the
00:16:17 seattle music scene
00:16:18 during this time and so i brought
00:16:20 together show us the show show us
00:16:22 um so i really want to highlight
00:16:25 this artist in particular um overton
00:16:28 berry
00:16:30 he just passed away on monday and he was
00:16:33 a huge figure
00:16:34 in the seattle music scene um
00:16:37 this is overton berry
00:16:41 so what a great
00:16:44 face what a smile he his his mom
00:16:48 apparently was really mean
00:16:50 he he like talked about her he was like
00:16:52 she's a scary lady but she made him
00:16:54 learn
00:16:54 piano she made him take piano lessons
00:16:57 and
00:16:58 um he actually went to cornish and so
00:17:01 he became a master piano player because
00:17:03 of this but um
00:17:05 when he was very young i think he was
00:17:07 only like 19
00:17:09 somehow he got hired as the music
00:17:12 director
00:17:13 for peggy lee's performance at the 1962
00:17:16 seattle world's fair
00:17:17 no way yeah and the amazing thing is
00:17:19 apparently she was like
00:17:22 super stickler very strict very serious
00:17:25 like took
00:17:25 everything super seriously and he
00:17:29 uh practiced the band that he put
00:17:31 together with her
00:17:32 like worked his ass off to make sure it
00:17:34 was
00:17:35 perfect right and he ran the sound in
00:17:38 the auditorium that she performed at
00:17:40 and apparently after the show it was
00:17:42 rave reviews except for the
00:17:44 sound in the auditorium and so she fired
00:17:47 him
00:17:48 that's a bummer but he was like he owned
00:17:51 uh he you know he's a cool guy he's like
00:17:52 i i admit okay fine you know i tried my
00:17:56 best and the best wasn't good enough
00:17:57 that's fine
00:17:58 but he was also um he also put together
00:18:01 sorry i'm taking notes because i have so
00:18:03 much to cover i don't want to forget
00:18:04 what i'm talking about
00:18:05 he put together um this venue called the
00:18:08 house of entertainment where
00:18:09 a bunch of jazz musicians would come and
00:18:12 jam
00:18:13 and they set it up as a coffee house so
00:18:14 that they didn't have to follow the
00:18:16 liquor
00:18:16 laws and it was all ages and they could
00:18:18 stay open late
00:18:20 and so um in 1962 he was curating
00:18:23 the artists that were coming through
00:18:24 this house of entertainment too so
00:18:27 and then in 1969 he
00:18:30 took up a residency um at the doubletree
00:18:34 inn
00:18:34 in aquila not a place i frequent
00:18:38 yeah right and it you you have to like
00:18:40 you have to know where
00:18:42 it is to get to it it's not just like oh
00:18:44 that's live music playing there tonight
00:18:46 fantastic i'll pull over like you really
00:18:47 have to know where it is
00:18:49 so he had a six day a week residency
00:18:52 with his trio
00:18:54 the overton berry trio so this this
00:18:56 record is
00:18:57 at the doubletrian um and it got to the
00:19:01 point where
00:19:01 people loved his programming so much
00:19:04 because he was working in covers he was
00:19:06 playing
00:19:06 different genres of music but all on the
00:19:08 piano with
00:19:10 a guitar electric guitar and electric
00:19:12 bass accompaniment
00:19:13 in the trio and people just started
00:19:16 going bananas for him and the regulars
00:19:17 started showing up every night and the
00:19:19 words started spreading
00:19:21 and it got to the point where there were
00:19:22 lines out the door doubletree in
00:19:25 to see it was like the hottest show in
00:19:26 town it was the hottest show in tuquela
00:19:28 in the general seattle area and uh
00:19:31 he he said that um sometimes his friends
00:19:34 were like when can i come see you in a
00:19:36 night where i don't have to stand in
00:19:37 line
00:19:38 and he was like mondays and then i got
00:19:39 to the point where mondays were lines
00:19:41 too
00:19:41 so um he did that for years but
00:19:44 uh his his claim to fame song
00:19:48 like his famous song this is so funny so
00:19:51 somebody came up to him one night and
00:19:52 was like
00:19:53 because you could request songs like you
00:19:54 have a piano player here at your
00:19:55 restaurant we
00:19:57 do and they play covers right all the
00:19:59 time yeah so somebody came up to overton
00:20:01 berry and was like
00:20:02 can you play hey jude by the beatles and
00:20:04 he's like oh i don't i don't know how to
00:20:06 play that
00:20:07 and the bass player was like yeah yeah
00:20:09 no we'll play it it's fine i'll teach
00:20:10 you
00:20:11 and he's like okay man and so he's like
00:20:13 don't worry about it
00:20:14 i'll teach you and so he just teaches
00:20:17 him
00:20:18 the last part of hey jude
00:20:22 so he learns it real quick and just uses
00:20:26 that phrase
00:20:27 and builds this amazing free-form song
00:20:31 out of it with
00:20:32 that part of hey jude is the backbone
00:20:35 and the owner came up and was like
00:20:37 i love that you're playing that every
00:20:38 night no way and in an interview is that
00:20:40 on the record
00:20:41 yeah okay i got it in an interview he
00:20:43 was like
00:20:45 hey jude's gonna be on my epitaph no way
00:20:48 because it's like a song he's known for
00:20:50 can i find him on like spotify or do i
00:20:52 need to go buy vinyl to listen
00:20:54 i i'm pretty sure you can find it
00:20:56 streaming okay because
00:20:57 most of the light lightning addict
00:20:59 records you can find on streaming i'm
00:21:00 sure
00:21:00 that's that's awesome you know i just
00:21:03 learned on the
00:21:05 chat when i was doing mark show with sam
00:21:08 someone commented that they
00:21:10 were at the camless restaurant in
00:21:13 waikiki
00:21:14 when frank sinatra was at the bar
00:21:17 drinking
00:21:19 and they invited him up to play at the
00:21:22 piano so i just learned for the first
00:21:23 time an hour ago that frank sinatra
00:21:25 played at camless
00:21:26 in waikiki just just riffing on the keys
00:21:28 mom my mom's
00:21:29 mom did you did you know that no
00:21:32 i don't think we knew that as a family
00:21:34 there's dad oh dad's here too
00:21:36 dad did you know frank sinatra played at
00:21:38 campus waikiki i did no
00:21:40 okay that's we didn't know that's
00:21:41 amazing but yeah just that this whole
00:21:43 the vibe we we love the world of
00:21:47 piano players and musicians in spaces
00:21:50 creating
00:21:51 and creating vibes creating atmosphere
00:21:53 yeah yeah
00:21:54 so um also at that time there like i
00:21:57 said there was a huge group of musicians
00:21:59 playing at this time and in 2010
00:22:04 um lightning attic put together a
00:22:06 compilation of a lot of those artists
00:22:08 and called it wheedle's groove so this
00:22:11 is a compilation of
00:22:12 various artists who are playing at that
00:22:14 time overton berry is part of that so
00:22:16 like
00:22:16 i'm pretty sure overton barry
00:22:19 yeah the hey jude is on here oh cool so
00:22:22 and it's
00:22:23 i see it says seattle's finest in funk
00:22:26 and soul
00:22:26 yeah is that we don't like weedle on the
00:22:28 needle weedle yes
00:22:30 so this is an amazing story i love this
00:22:32 story can i please tell the story yes
00:22:34 okay great
00:22:35 so um the the weedle
00:22:38 the basketball team sonics and all of
00:22:41 these artists
00:22:43 are inter-intertwined because of the
00:22:46 weedle
00:22:47 so this is really interesting um i have
00:22:50 this weedles groove box set that like
00:22:51 wait so like the weedle on the needle
00:22:53 the kids book that my kids love that all
00:22:55 kids love
00:22:56 yeah so there was this author in 1974
00:23:00 who was like i want to write a book
00:23:04 about seattle on the space needle and so
00:23:06 made up this character called the weedle
00:23:09 and the the premise of the story is the
00:23:11 weedle lives on top of the space needle
00:23:13 the glowing red light at the top of the
00:23:16 space needle is the weedle's nose
00:23:18 and so when um in the morning
00:23:22 when all of the seattle residents wake
00:23:24 up and they go to work
00:23:26 they whistle when they go to work and
00:23:27 they wake up the wheel
00:23:29 and that pisses the wheel off he does
00:23:31 not like that so he makes rain clouds
00:23:32 come and that's why it rains in seattle
00:23:35 to dampen everybody and shut them up so
00:23:38 he's very grinchy so everybody gets
00:23:40 together
00:23:41 and they're like let's make him some
00:23:44 noise cancelling headphones
00:23:46 and he's like oh great thanks and then
00:23:47 he goes back to sleep so that's a weedle
00:23:49 on the needle right
00:23:50 so this guy writes this and it becomes
00:23:53 a best-selling kid's book so that's
00:23:55 around the country right around the
00:23:56 country so that's the origin of the
00:23:58 weedle okay
00:23:59 and at that time uh
00:24:02 seattle did not have a baseball team yet
00:24:04 or football or football
00:24:05 so really the only professional sports
00:24:07 team that was going on at the time
00:24:09 are dearly beloved seattle supersonics
00:24:11 fallen forgotten sonic not forgotten
00:24:13 yeah never forgot they'll be back one
00:24:15 day one day
00:24:16 we'll get them back don't you worry yeah
00:24:18 um they're just
00:24:20 taking a vacation in oklahoma a small
00:24:23 break
00:24:23 so the author of that children's book
00:24:26 talked to i believe the owner of the
00:24:29 sonics and was like
00:24:30 i want to make a weedle costume i want
00:24:33 to get in it i want to get in that
00:24:34 costume
00:24:35 and i want to come out on the court i
00:24:36 don't want to be the weedle at the
00:24:38 sonic's game and he was like
00:24:40 no that sounds stupid with the first
00:24:42 okay keep going keep going yeah so he
00:24:44 was like
00:24:44 okay fine i'm gonna go sit in the stands
00:24:46 and i'm gonna be in the weedles costume
00:24:48 i'm gonna create
00:24:49 a big scene so either way i'm getting
00:24:51 attention in my weedles costume he's
00:24:52 like
00:24:53 fine you can be on the court so
00:24:58 so the first sonic's mascot so the
00:25:01 so it becomes the first mascot
00:25:05 ever in the nba was that was the white
00:25:08 the weedle
00:25:09 and they put out trading cards and the
00:25:11 weedle got its own
00:25:13 trading card and so a local band
00:25:16 called anaconda um this is a
00:25:19 deep trivia right wrote two sonics
00:25:22 related songs
00:25:23 okay they wrote wheedle's groove and
00:25:26 then on the other side was
00:25:28 sonic boom and so the song by anaconda
00:25:32 is how light in the attic chose to cull
00:25:35 the very size compilation weedles wheels
00:25:38 groove
00:25:39 the end no we keep going
00:25:42 so um that's awesome in 2010
00:25:47 uh the mayor mike mcginn at the time
00:25:50 declared it wheedle's groove day on
00:25:53 september 4th
00:25:54 2010 and that was also the day
00:25:57 of the the first day of the 40th
00:26:00 anniversary of bomber shoot
00:26:02 so a bunch of these artists got together
00:26:06 and played a show at bumbershoot no way
00:26:08 and then they also went to garfield and
00:26:10 took a giant picture
00:26:12 uh with with as many of these artists
00:26:15 playing
00:26:15 at that time as you've discovered the
00:26:18 the funk soul history of this town yeah
00:26:21 do you work that music into your show i
00:26:24 mean yeah

00:26:36 wheels groove
00:26:37 of the cause he went to garfield too was
00:26:40 it big hair at the time he had big hair
00:26:41 at the time okay
00:26:42 yeah okay let's let's let's let's move
00:26:45 into into the
00:26:46 um let's go to grunge
00:26:50 okay we've made our way to the 90s i
00:26:52 just want to
00:26:53 mention the sonics tell me real quick
00:26:57 tacoma origin of the seattle rock scene
00:27:00 really is
00:27:00 sonic's also want to mention kearney
00:27:03 barton
00:27:04 who is a producer of he
00:27:07 he recorded the sonics he recorded the
00:27:10 the
00:27:10 heart sisters and and nancy wilson he
00:27:12 recorded a ton of the weedles groove
00:27:14 artists
00:27:15 he is considered like the the godfather
00:27:19 of he like
00:27:20 he is the state he created the seattle
00:27:21 sound so
00:27:23 one last thing i want to mention is that
00:27:24 this year lightning addict put out
00:27:26 a compilation called kearny architect of
00:27:28 the northwest sound
00:27:29 because when he died in 2012
00:27:34 they found 7 000 tapes in his house and
00:27:37 the university of washington went and
00:27:38 cataloged
00:27:39 all of them no way and lightning addict
00:27:41 pulled out some
00:27:43 of them that's a cool attraction is that
00:27:45 the one you're holding right there
00:27:46 no this is this is actually um before
00:27:48 kearney barton died
00:27:50 they recorded uh it's another weedles
00:27:52 group they recorded
00:27:55 yeah yeah it's part of that series yeah
00:27:58 so um my co-worker johnny horn who hosts
00:28:01 preaching the blues he music directed
00:28:03 this and put together a band and played
00:28:04 with kearney barton
00:28:06 and uh they covered soundgarden's jesus
00:28:08 christ pose so now we can talk about
00:28:10 grunge
00:28:11 there's the segway okay what
00:28:15 happened what happened i mean the world
00:28:18 exploded we had we had yeah
00:28:20 we had the big four right uh sound
00:28:23 garden
00:28:24 nirvana pearl jam allison james
00:28:28 ex in this city and then uh and then
00:28:31 the world yeah so um
00:28:35 the it is said that the seattle sound
00:28:38 took a
00:28:39 a 180 from sol and funk to
00:28:43 what is dark and moody and angry grunge
00:28:46 yeah
00:28:47 so um we can't talk about these bands
00:28:50 without talking about
00:28:51 subpop records okay right so um
00:28:55 okay so nirvana kurt cobain is from
00:28:58 aberdeen
00:28:59 he recorded music played music out there
00:29:03 eventually ended up moving out to
00:29:04 seattle um
00:29:06 my favorite kurt cobain story is very
00:29:08 relevant so
00:29:10 this is tizen kexp which is super cool
00:29:12 so
00:29:13 um nirvana recorded a cover
00:29:17 of this song from the 60s originally
00:29:20 done by shocking blue called love buzz
00:29:22 and i'm sure everyone knows that nirvana
00:29:25 song like it's
00:29:26 a super popular song that's their first
00:29:27 single ever so
00:29:30 um kurt cobain drives to kcmu
00:29:33 in the early 90s at the university of
00:29:34 washington drops off the demo
00:29:37 this was this was the station with the
00:29:38 three block radius
00:29:40 like because it was only 10 amps or
00:29:42 something or yeah exactly
00:29:44 so um so hands
00:29:47 hands whoever at the station the demo
00:29:49 here's my tape yeah
00:29:50 drives away to the edge of the listening
00:29:52 radius gets on a pay phone calls and
00:29:54 requests his
00:29:55 song and god bless the dj on air they
00:29:58 played it
00:29:59 and and he sat there because it was a
00:30:01 sound probably
00:30:03 unlike anyone i'd heard before yeah and
00:30:06 as
00:30:06 as a dj do you have those moments when
00:30:09 you
00:30:10 when you hear a sound and you're like oh
00:30:12 yeah and do you
00:30:13 do you wonder if this is the next thing
00:30:15 does it do you sometimes
00:30:17 do you take wrists like that on the air
00:30:19 oh definitely
00:30:20 yes that's the beauty do you ever regret
00:30:22 them no
00:30:23 okay i never regret playing music huh
00:30:27 you know it's it's art it's life
00:30:31 you know you can you can love a song and
00:30:33 then
00:30:34 listen to it five years later and be
00:30:35 like whoa i don't like it so much
00:30:37 you know it's just it's just a moment in
00:30:39 time there's there's nothing wrong with
00:30:41 showcasing
00:30:41 art at the time wow um so so they play
00:30:45 love buzz and he hears himself on the
00:30:47 radio in his car
00:30:49 and that's the first time he hurt
00:30:50 himself and then um
00:30:52 so sub pop records so you say the top
00:30:55 four
00:30:56 i said the big four big four it should
00:30:57 really be the big five
00:30:59 because mud honey is very very important
00:31:02 in the grunge so
00:31:06 um sub pop's very first release
00:31:09 was mud honeys touch me i'm sick
00:31:12 uh single that was their very first
00:31:15 official
00:31:15 subpop release okay in 1988
00:31:18 um touch me i'm sick and this is a very
00:31:21 interesting fact so
00:31:23 right out the gate they advertised it as
00:31:25 a limited
00:31:27 quantity so subpop is credited with
00:31:30 um creating the that fault like that
00:31:33 false sense of
00:31:34 uh god have that yeah the scarcity yeah
00:31:37 the scarcity mindset the like
00:31:38 i gotta have that the collector's item
00:31:39 yeah so that that can be
00:31:41 it could be attributed to subpah and
00:31:44 then
00:31:44 the second subtop release was
00:31:47 nirvana's love buzz wow yeah
00:31:51 so um and then does that mean that
00:31:55 pop hears it on the radio at kcmu and it
00:31:58 was like i love this sound
00:32:00 so sub pop was just bruce pavitt he's
00:32:02 just a guy
00:32:03 just one man first favorite okay so
00:32:06 bruce pavett moved out here from
00:32:07 illinois
00:32:08 um and he moved out here with uh
00:32:11 kim's isle of soundgarden or and and um
00:32:15 uh hero from sound garden as well
00:32:18 so they all moved out here and uh bruce
00:32:21 pavett
00:32:22 for the first i want to say three years
00:32:25 um had a zine called subterranean pop
00:32:29 and the zine would come with i think a
00:32:31 mixtape or something
00:32:32 of songs that he liked which is like a
00:32:34 small magazine
00:32:36 yeah like a magazine okay yeah like a
00:32:38 newspaper like the rocket back
00:32:39 got it and it came with a tape yeah
00:32:41 that's cool yeah so he did that for a
00:32:43 while and then
00:32:44 um when he when he released mud honeys
00:32:47 touch me i'm sick he's like okay this is
00:32:49 an official label
00:32:50 this is what we're doing now this is
00:32:51 what i'm doing now wow so then
00:32:54 and then released nirvana and just had
00:32:56 like great
00:32:57 great taste right away so then in the
00:33:00 meantime
00:33:02 the other who ended up being his partner
00:33:04 at subpop jonathan ponnaman
00:33:06 was a dj at kcmu no way and he happened
00:33:10 to see soundgarden play because
00:33:12 kim kim and hiro moved here with bruce
00:33:15 they ended up meeting
00:33:16 uh chris cornell and i'm spacing on
00:33:18 names but they became a band
00:33:21 and uh jonathan potterman saw them play
00:33:24 a show and was like
00:33:25 holy that band's good and like
00:33:27 played them on casey and mew and was
00:33:29 like i'm not kidding you need to know
00:33:31 about this band this is sound garden
00:33:32 this is sound garden wow and and then um
00:33:35 reached out to bruce pavett and was like
00:33:38 i will front the money for you to
00:33:40 release soundgarden
00:33:42 and and then he ended up becoming the
00:33:45 partner
00:33:46 at subpop and so it was those two
00:33:48 running it until 1996.
00:33:50 wow yeah so
00:33:53 and then allison chains was not on step
00:33:56 up
00:33:57 um okay and neither was pearl jam
00:34:00 neither was pearl jam but do you know
00:34:03 that pearl jam had
00:34:04 a lot of members that were mike mccready
00:34:06 himself
00:34:07 yeah played at the canvas bingo show
00:34:10 in this very room the legend
00:34:14 the canvas bingo show the world's most
00:34:16 underrated
00:34:17 musical variety show it's definitely the
00:34:20 most underrated
00:34:21 bingo show most underwatched most music
00:34:24 show
00:34:25 i'm sure mike felt that during the
00:34:27 performance
00:34:28 he is such a good uh guy for the city
00:34:31 okay he was on our board of directors
00:34:33 too when we were moving into this
00:34:34 he's the best yeah he's he was
00:34:36 instrumental in us
00:34:37 moving into our building that we're in
00:34:39 today he's a great guy um
00:34:41 okay and then so seb pop becomes this
00:34:43 label that starts to launch
00:34:45 independent music around i mean like
00:34:48 seattle starts to become known for not
00:34:50 just
00:34:50 grunge yeah but indie music
00:34:54 yeah and now and now with your like oh i
00:34:56 gotta collect them all right
00:34:57 right that what stuff pop is drumming up
00:34:59 and and they're uh
00:35:01 it is said that they've they marketed
00:35:04 the
00:35:04 seattle sound which is grunge so maybe
00:35:07 they maybe they told us
00:35:09 it's the seattle sound you know what i
00:35:10 mean yeah maybe maybe they did maybe
00:35:12 they did
00:35:13 so um so yeah people are like oh i gotta

00:35:30 with it so nirvana's bleach
00:35:33 is really what is the that's the money
00:35:36 maker for stop popping that was the
00:35:37 moment and i think i
00:35:38 i i learned because i've done a tour of
00:35:40 subpop with those guys and
00:35:42 it's such a an amazing space that album
00:35:45 saved them
00:35:46 it saved them they were in a dark place
00:35:48 i mean
00:35:49 owning a record label is kind of a money
00:35:51 pit yeah right
00:35:52 like well they're making loser t-shirts
00:35:55 that and that was paying the bills
00:35:56 yeah like yeah yeah yeah and then
00:36:00 and then bleach yeah so a lot of times
00:36:02 with a record label you just
00:36:03 you get that one album yeah and that's
00:36:05 floating everything else
00:36:07 so really they were like oh
00:36:09  and bleach comes out and it's like
00:36:10 wow to this day that there's only
00:36:14 two platinum platinum albums
00:36:17 it sells over a million copies of sub

00:36:48 come on yeah garden stain i mean i was
00:36:50 trying to select that movie
00:36:51 i'm saying shit's changed your life okay
00:36:53 you couldn't uh okay then
00:36:55 um indie music is established
00:36:59 and seattle becomes established as this
00:37:02 mecca of
00:37:03 independent music yeah um but and we've
00:37:05 talked about
00:37:06 grunge we've talked about independent
00:37:07 music we've talked about
00:37:09 funk and soul yeah we have talked about
00:37:12 hip-hop yeah we can talk about hip-hop
00:37:13 um
00:37:14 that we we also have hip-hop i mean i
00:37:17 mean cermak's a lot the
00:37:18 grandfather but like the but like the
00:37:21 the
00:37:22 blue scholars or even macklemore today
00:37:24 like what's that scene
00:37:25 been like in in this town yeah so
00:37:28 i was like is it i've i looked because i
00:37:31 was like is really sir mixoloth the
00:37:32 first
00:37:33 and really he's like the first his posse
00:37:35 was on broadway yeah that was his second
00:37:38 single it was pop my possibilities
00:37:41 it's so good yeah he the the story is
00:37:44 because
00:37:44 he didn't really hang out in capitol
00:37:46 hill he lived in the central district
00:37:48 and then
00:37:49 um if only his posse had been on aurora
00:37:52 yeah
00:37:52 like you know we maybe we could but
00:37:55 my posse's at the marco polo
00:38:00 yeah so um he lived in the central
00:38:02 district and part of the
00:38:04 the like ending of of racial segregation
00:38:07 the redlining was
00:38:09 the the city decided to
00:38:12 sort of push in integration by
00:38:15 busing students from the central
00:38:18 district into the
00:38:19 the high schools in northern seattle so
00:38:22 sir mixolot was being
00:38:24 bussed to like eckstein middle school
00:38:26 and then to roosevelt high school
00:38:28 um so that's where he was he was going
00:38:30 which roosevelt has an amazing
00:38:32 music program too but uh apparently his
00:38:35 teachers were like you should be a music
00:38:37 teacher and he was like
00:38:38 i want to be a dj so um as soon as he
00:38:41 graduated high school he was
00:38:43 he was in like the boys and girls club
00:38:45 down in rainier
00:38:46 valley um playing dj sets and dance
00:38:49 nights and stuff and then
00:38:50 um he met uh
00:38:54 i'm not remembering the name but there
00:38:56 was a there was a radio station
00:38:59 um that was the first that had the first
00:39:02 rap
00:39:02 show and he became friends with that dj
00:39:06 and then they
00:39:06 collaborated and and created a their own
00:39:09 little record label together and that's
00:39:11 when he released
00:39:12 um his first song
00:39:15 and it blew up and then he put out swas
00:39:18 and and then uh in 1992 that's when you
00:39:21 know baby got back
00:39:23 uh and that changed everything right
00:39:25 yeah so he really he really is sort of
00:39:27 like the
00:39:28 the seattle's hip-hop godfather is such
00:39:31 a nice person what's so funny when
00:39:32 you're talking about
00:39:33 a band named anaconda earlier
00:39:36 where we got the the weedle yeah is that
00:39:38 what he's referring to when my anaconda
00:39:40 don't work
00:39:41 done no anaconda spelled differently in
00:39:44 the band i was just checking
00:39:45 maybe it was a seattle music history it
00:39:47 could be it could be it could be
00:39:49 it could be maybe that's what he meant i
00:39:51 think he meant his penis but
00:39:52 um they've also meant that it was a
00:39:55 double encounter double entendre but um
00:39:57 hip hop so
00:39:59 yes uh blue scholars are an amazing
00:40:01 group but there's also
00:40:02 this uh this amazing collective in
00:40:05 seattle called the black
00:40:06 constellation collective that's shabazz
00:40:08 palaces
00:40:09 um the satisfaction who are no longer
00:40:11 together but

00:40:58 how are we doing you got like 15 minutes
00:41:00 you guys are good awesome
00:41:02 um but i have so much more to say i know
00:41:10 morgan knows you have like 500 fans who
00:41:14 are like hugely in your camper
00:41:16 so just keep going basically we learned
00:41:18 that okay your show's at 12-3 at kxp
00:41:20 yeah every saturday yes and you you can
00:41:23 we can text you
00:41:24 during the show and you answer yeah so
00:41:27 we um
00:41:28 we are so community oriented we love our
00:41:31 listeners interacting with us
00:41:33 we're super interested in having like
00:41:36 real-time shows so i don't really
00:41:38 plan my show too much because i want to
00:41:40 be working in your requests i want to be
00:41:42 responding to world events i want to be
00:41:45 feeling the flow of it
00:41:47 and people connecting with me is a huge
00:41:49 part of that
00:41:50 so um when we do our live shows when we
00:41:53 take mic breaks we invite people to
00:41:54 email or text us and
00:41:56 people write in just say hi or and
00:41:58 that's people from all over the world do
00:41:59 it yeah
00:42:00 yeah and also there's an earlier
00:42:02 question around just like really
00:42:03 radio you know because it seems so
00:42:05 analogous to old-fashioned but isn't
00:42:07 that really what's
00:42:08 the difference between a live dj
00:42:11 and and live radio as opposed to just
00:42:14 spotify
00:42:15 interactive yeah talk about that
00:42:16 algorithms are soulless
00:42:18 and i think spotify
00:42:20 [Laughter]
00:42:22 it spotify's the devil what no
00:42:26 talk about that is that because the the
00:42:28 like if an artist gets their song played
00:42:30 on your radio station
00:42:31 are they uh better compensated than if i
00:42:34 played them
00:42:34 on my spotify playlist so okay the
00:42:37 benefit
00:42:38 of hearing it on kxp for example
00:42:42 is i can provide you a resource to go
00:42:45 buy their music
00:42:46 i can put on the playlist here is their
00:42:48 bandcamp link you should go
00:42:50 support this artist whereas spotify is
00:42:53 interested in
00:42:54 having they did you know that they
00:42:57 ask artists to make their songs certain
00:43:00 time
00:43:00 lengths because psychologically they're
00:43:03 like oh people only listen to a song
00:43:05 that's 3 minutes and 30 seconds so they
00:43:06 ask artists to alter their songs to fit
00:43:09 their algorithm i hate it
00:43:11 so it's an awkward time to bring up the
00:43:13 fact that spotify is sponsored this hour
00:43:15 [Laughter]
00:43:23 no so you know um there's there's
00:43:26 nothing that can beat the human
00:43:28 connection there's nothing that can beat
00:43:29 the
00:43:30 surprise that you feel when you hear
00:43:34 what a human has picked for you to hear
00:43:36 next the connection that it's made
00:43:38 when you're listening to an algorithm
00:43:40 you're like
00:43:42 that song didn't go with the that last
00:43:44 song that look
00:43:45 that was a terrible transition why am i
00:43:47 listening to this now
00:43:48 or you know you get an ad thrown in the
00:43:50 middle of it or
00:43:52 um you know it only cycles through like
00:43:54 five different artists but
00:43:57 you're not maybe gonna well sometimes i
00:43:59 play the same artist if there's a reason
00:44:01 but you're not gonna hear a lot of
00:44:03 repeats you're gonna hear
00:44:05 me going down all different pathways but
00:44:08 it's all going to make sense because i'm
00:44:10 i'm being very purposeful about like
00:44:12 what are the sounds connecting those two
00:44:14 songs because you you have
00:44:16 literally millions of songs at your
00:44:18 fingers at my fingertips
00:44:19 and how is that not the most
00:44:21 overwhelming anxiety producing thing to
00:44:23 choose
00:44:24 like how do you choose what comes next
00:44:26 how do you choose the paths that you
00:44:28 take
00:44:29 well it takes a lot of practice it was
00:44:32 like a panic attack
00:44:33 every time i was on the air for like the
00:44:34 first four years
00:44:36 but after after a while it becomes
00:44:39 uh more second nature but so you know i
00:44:42 i
00:44:42 definitely have songs that i know i want
00:44:44 to play during a show for example
00:44:46 um i also uh as a as a
00:44:50 rule at kxp we play
00:44:53 half new music every hour particularly
00:44:56 on the variety mix shows because we have
00:44:58 specialty shows where they dig into a
00:44:59 genre and
00:45:00 not you don't have to necessarily play
00:45:02 new music but for my show and
00:45:04 uh in particular i'm a variety variety
00:45:06 mix show because i can
00:45:07 play any genre whatever i want so
00:45:10 half of an hour i'm playing brand new
00:45:13 music
00:45:13 so i know that right and then my
00:45:17 my goal is to build context around that
00:45:21 new music that you've never heard
00:45:23 so that it becomes familiar to you
00:45:26 so i'm playing a brand new song you've
00:45:27 never heard and if it reminds me of
00:45:31 david bowie yeah now you've made that
00:45:34 connection in your mind and that's
00:45:35 that new thing isn't scary anymore it's
00:45:38 accessible to you right there's
00:45:39 there's context around it i'm also
00:45:41 working in people's requests i'm also
00:45:43 like
00:45:43 responding to world events um
00:45:47 it could be as simple as you know it's
00:45:49 been cloudy for
00:45:50 six straight months and today is a sunny
00:45:52 day and now i'm like let's play sun
00:45:54 songs everybody's like yeah let's plays
00:45:56 you said you said earlier to me that you
00:45:58 receive
00:45:59 a ton of demo tapes just like kurt
00:46:01 cobain sent in
00:46:02 all the time yeah like how many i get
00:46:04 people emailing me
00:46:06 i get uh they're not tapes anymore i
00:46:08 guess are they they're digital
00:46:09 yeah and it's better for the environment
00:46:11 like how many do you get and do you
00:46:12 listen to all of them and do you play
00:46:14 some of them lord i try i try to i try
00:46:17 to listen
00:46:18 to all of them i get and do you know
00:46:20 right away like this is actually good
00:46:22 and this is not good
00:46:24 well i don't say good or not good i say
00:46:26 what are my preferences
00:46:28 okay what is my personal taste because
00:46:30 your art is your art and
00:46:33 good for you for making it what is my
00:46:35 personal taste
00:46:36 yes of course so i get
00:46:39 probably between 10 to 30
00:46:42 a day in my inbox and i
00:46:45 because i'm i also have big jobby job
00:46:48 that requires emailing i
00:46:49 throw them into a folder immediately
00:46:52 and then i i try at least once a week to
00:46:55 go in that folder and
00:46:56 go through everything since the last
00:46:58 time i went through it is that what you
00:46:59 do on the ferry
00:47:00 yeah sometimes yeah just like listen to
00:47:03 music yeah
00:47:05 when's the last time you heard a song
00:47:07 that you actually like stopped you you
00:47:09 were like
00:47:11 oh this is this is awesome so my most
00:47:14 recent
00:47:15 ear worm and this is probably gonna
00:47:16 double up as an answer to another
00:47:18 question later but
00:47:19 um local band deep sea diver
00:47:22 oh yeah just put out an amazing album
00:47:25 yes called impossible weight yes and the
00:47:28 title track
00:47:29 impossible weight has been in my goddamn
00:47:32 head for
00:47:33 a month it's it's all i can hear in my
00:47:35 head good
00:47:36 so we talked about this because um one
00:47:39 of the field trips
00:47:40 yeah that candles community college is
00:47:42 going to do it's not really a field trip
00:47:43 but
00:47:44 we're we're going to go to our parking
00:47:45 lot and we have we're going to do a drum
00:47:47 circle
00:47:48 yeah we're going to have a bonfire we're
00:47:50 going to drink whiskey
00:47:51 and deep sea diver is going to come lead
00:47:53 us in a drum circle
00:47:54 in our parking lot that sounds weird you
00:47:57 should come
00:47:58 when is that uh we haven't announced it
00:48:00 yet right now i think it's kind of dude
00:48:03 yeah but it's coming we'll talk because
00:48:05 deep sander is one of my favorite bands
00:48:07 that the city's ever produced
00:48:08 they're extremely talented yeah and we
00:48:11 played their entire album on release day
00:48:13 did you know that
00:48:14 uh on exp no you played the whole thing
00:48:16 start to finish we played one song per
00:48:18 hour and jessica recorded herself
00:48:21 talking about every track
00:48:22 isn't she the best yeah it was amazing
00:48:25 so for 12 straight hours
00:48:28 the whole deep sea diver album and her
00:48:30 husband's the drummer a lot of people
00:48:31 don't know that yeah
00:48:32 and he's like the kindest man
00:48:36 uh so that's a song recently where i'm
00:48:38 like that's a hit
00:48:40 like you heard it and you're like boom
00:48:41 done yep
00:48:43 yeah okay uh i'm hosting a party in my
00:48:46 house
00:48:48 and i want to build a playlist and you
00:48:50 know
00:48:51 how do i do that how how what
00:48:55 what advice would you give me if i want
00:48:56 to be a dj
00:48:58 so the first thing you want to consider
00:49:01 is what kind of party is it is it a
00:49:03 chill atmosphere
00:49:04 is it a party atmosphere are you getting
00:49:06 drunk it's sadly not a ranger
00:49:08 i have three small kids but yes you know
00:49:10 what i mean yeah like figure out the
00:49:11 mood
00:49:11 what's the mood okay now you also have
00:49:15 to think about your
00:49:16 audience who's going to be there
00:49:19 for content but also for for uh
00:49:22 what do you think people would like
00:49:23 because there's nothing worse than a mix
00:49:25 that you've made that everybody just is
00:49:27 like not into that's sad right
00:49:29 you're only programming for yourself but
00:49:30 do you do do i focus on
00:49:32 hits that people know or do i try to try
00:49:35 do you try to educate your audience at
00:49:36 the same time well i think what you want
00:49:38 to do is
00:49:38 exactly what i just said about what i do
00:49:40 in my show
00:49:41 where you play a familiar thing to hook
00:49:44 them
00:49:45 got it and then you introduce them to
00:49:47 something they're going to love
00:49:49 that reminds them of the other thing
00:49:51 right so
00:49:52 you don't want to get too obscure
00:49:54 because otherwise your audience will be
00:49:56 tuning out what you're playing
00:49:58 at your party right so you wanna
00:50:00 obviously play some
00:50:01 play some bangers play some things that
00:50:03 people are gonna know and love
00:50:05 and then if you want to introduce them
00:50:06 to something new you can slip it in that
00:50:08 way you know
00:50:10 slip it in uh mark we got a lot of
00:50:13 questions
00:50:13 yeah yeah it was kind of like i know i
00:50:15 know getting low on time is it okay
00:50:17 if i could we do just sort of like a
00:50:19 rapid fire grab a fire
00:50:21 rapid fire questions to morgan not me
00:50:24 okay yeah so uh here we go morgan um
00:50:27 a lot of okay i can't i can't overstate
00:50:30 i would i would be doing the chat
00:50:32 an injustice if i didn't just say
00:50:34 directly to you
00:50:36 a lot of fans out there loving what
00:50:38 you're
00:50:45 cheers friends we're going to keep this
00:50:47 up sometimes you're having a nice time
00:50:48 okay
00:50:48 a couple of questions here um one what
00:50:51 is the best way
00:50:53 like to support the seattle music scene
00:50:55 like
00:50:56 right now you can't go to live venues
00:50:58 and people sort of looking at like you
00:50:59 know from the
00:51:00 insider's point of view um you know
00:51:03 what's a great way to support
00:51:05 just if you're into this and you're
00:51:06 tracking like how do you do this
00:51:08 yeah so um specifically with the venues
00:51:10 being closed right now
00:51:12 there's there's a campaign that just
00:51:14 launched recently called
00:51:16 uh keep keepmusiclivewa.org i believe um
00:51:22 they're they're actively collecting
00:51:24 donations for our local venues
00:51:27 if you've been around seattle at all and
00:51:29 you've walked by any of the
00:51:30 major venues like numos for example they
00:51:33 have
00:51:34 big mock signs on them that say that you
00:51:37 know those construction signs they're
00:51:38 like this is going to turn into condos
00:51:40 it looks real it gave several people a
00:51:44 heart attack when they saw it but it's
00:51:45 like this could be the future if we
00:51:47 don't act now and help
00:51:49 so um that's a great way to help the
00:51:51 venues specifically
00:51:53 to help artists specifically because
00:51:55 obviously to make money
00:51:57 especially when they're releasing new
00:51:58 albums they have to tour because really
00:52:00 touring is where the money is
00:52:01 so buying their albums
00:52:05 is and their merch is the best way you
00:52:07 can support artists right now
00:52:09 like direct feed to the artist directly
00:52:12 as opposed to maybe going
00:52:13 love our neighbors down the amazon folks
00:52:16 here that are building this
00:52:17 city single-handedly but maybe like if
00:52:19 you want to directly support an artist
00:52:20 just go buy the album
00:52:21 yeah so if you want to buy their
00:52:24 physical stuff you can either buy it
00:52:25 directly from them
00:52:27 most artists have band camps band camp
00:52:29 is a very benevolent organization
00:52:31 every first friday of every month during
00:52:33 this pandemic they're doing
00:52:35 um 100 of all album sales go
00:52:38 directly to the artist the first friday
00:52:40 of every month so if you're if you want
00:52:42 to wait a little bit
00:52:43 wait till the first november first
00:52:46 friday excuse me the first
00:52:47 deep sea diver on the first yeah okay uh
00:52:50 but double whammy support your local
00:52:52 brick and mortar record stores
00:52:54 next question is a little bit crystal
00:52:56 ball theme
00:52:57 here um we're looking to know from you
00:53:00 the next seattle music genre
00:53:04 oh genre genre like like
00:53:07 it says genre i don't make this stuff up
00:53:09 i try to accurately represent the thread
00:53:11 that's going on
00:53:12 you know what or or the bands she's most
00:53:15 excited about
00:53:16 okay so we sort of say grunge kind of
00:53:17 came from seattle and other sort of
00:53:19 major movements came from seattle is
00:53:20 there anything
00:53:21 maybe that we're seeing emerge right now
00:53:23 that could that could
00:53:25 you know produce a genre
00:53:29 well i think there's um
00:53:32 there's a few bands that are
00:53:35 creating rock music that i think is
00:53:39 more original and less derivative but is
00:53:42 still in the rock umbrella
00:53:44 uh black tones are a great example of
00:53:46 that
00:53:47 i love them so much not only that but
00:53:49 eva walker is our audio aces hosting kxp
00:53:52 but they're an amazing band
00:53:53 um black tones black tones uh
00:53:56 black ends is another holy crap
00:54:00 that lady's voice is so awesome the
00:54:02 black ends
00:54:03 black ends yeah they um
00:54:06 she's put on ep called stay evil
00:54:10 that's a really good ep it's really good
00:54:12 day evil that's cool
00:54:13 uh the song monday morning it's very
00:54:15 good yeah um
00:54:16 i think that's trump's campaign promise
00:54:19 that's great make america it's his new
00:54:22 poster
00:54:23 just keep it the way sorry apologies um
00:54:25 music so when you see trends coming
00:54:27 and you know it's like the movements or
00:54:29 the or the things that
00:54:31 are exciting to you like like what are
00:54:33 you like what is exciting to you about
00:54:35 right now and like what's happening in
00:54:36 music in this
00:54:37 in this city yeah i feel like we're
00:54:40 we're almost in a
00:54:42 post-trend environment because
00:54:45 um the the internet and the way that
00:54:49 people produce music
00:54:51 is has leveled the playing field in a
00:54:54 way
00:54:54 where you're there's not as much
00:54:59 sound gatekeeping does that make sense
00:55:01 so like
00:55:02 during there was a period of time in in
00:55:04 seattle where it was like wow that's a
00:55:05 lot
00:55:06 of folk bands you know yeah because
00:55:08 that's
00:55:09 what who were getting signed that's who
00:55:11 you were being served to hear that's
00:55:13 who was getting the shows at the venues
00:55:17 you know um i feel like we've gotten to
00:55:20 a place where
00:55:22 there are a lot of really amazing
00:55:24 talented bands in every
00:55:26 sort of genre like the true loves are
00:55:29 a killer soul band um
00:55:33 uh uh odessa is an
00:55:36 electronic duo that um in the last two
00:55:40 years like
00:55:41 broke out of seattle and selling out
00:55:43 stadium shows and that's electronic you
00:55:45 know
00:55:45 so there's just there's so many
00:55:47 different genres in seattle
00:55:49 um i highly recommend if you're really
00:55:51 interested in learning
00:55:52 the the newest best music you should
00:55:55 listen to the
00:55:56 local show on kxp hosted by eva walker
00:55:58 called audioasis
00:56:00 which is saturday six to nine she's
00:56:02 scouring
00:56:03 the city for the best new local music
00:56:06 and you will hear it on her show
00:56:08 yeah and and that's been the tradition
00:56:10 of audio oasis
00:56:12 ready for this um i don't know if you
00:56:13 can do this favorite favorite video
00:56:16 oh i mean we have some cool i love them
00:56:18 all but i think
00:56:19 um as as an audience member i have
00:56:23 i always have the best time at showbox
00:56:25 market
00:56:26 i also really love numos if you could
00:56:28 watch
00:56:30 any historical seattle show in any venue
00:56:33 at any time what would that woman show
00:56:35 up oh it's just like you know what's
00:56:37 your favorite children right now these
00:56:38 are tough questions
00:56:39 i know i'm just my favorite i didn't say
00:56:41 your favorite just choose one like
00:56:43 is there is is there is there an artist
00:56:45 in history at it
00:56:47 is it the doubletree i mean that would
00:56:49 be amazing to see overton at the
00:56:51 doubletree that would be very very cool
00:56:53 i would not mind that at all okay so we
00:56:55 skipped country western i don't know if
00:56:57 that was intentional
00:56:59 is there any seattle country western we
00:57:01 should be paying attention to
00:57:02 or are we just not there is yeah of
00:57:05 course there is
00:57:06 okay um come on can we there's every
00:57:08 genre is what i'm saying
00:57:10 well okay so um two here's
00:57:13 here's an example of two major country
00:57:16 or country-ish
00:57:17 artists that have come out of the
00:57:18 seattle area one is one of my favorite
00:57:21 artists of all time nico case
00:57:22 oh yeah i mean come on and then brandie
00:57:25 carlisle of course
00:57:26 oh she's the freaking best yeah you say
00:57:29 her name earlier should have said that
00:57:30 she's country-ish yeah gosh she's good
00:57:34 she's very good yeah and um wife is the
00:57:37 greatest
00:57:38 and there are other bands and
00:57:41 i cannot that's okay there are so many
00:57:43 things
00:57:44 but yes there are of course there aren't
00:57:46 right we're nearly out of touch i don't
00:57:47 know if there's anything
00:57:48 that you want to particularly close with
00:57:49 i'm going to scroll through the thread
00:57:51 here real quickly but
00:57:52 yeah okay um
00:57:55 i do have something fun i uh
00:57:58 i teased this earlier and i don't know
00:58:00 if you know that we could possibly
00:58:02 pull it off or not and i'm seeing that i
00:58:06 think we can do it
00:58:08 i i i like what are you doing what's
00:58:11 happening
00:58:11 it's is it true that you were the lead
00:58:15 singer
00:58:16 of a band yes back in the
00:58:21 uh it was 2008 to 2010 the name of your
00:58:24 band
00:58:24 the broken knives which you can't find
00:58:26 anywhere no we didn't release anything
00:58:28 you can't find it we broke up before the
00:58:29 album came out right and
00:58:31 you know how you do but you're a great
00:58:33 singer and i i
00:58:35 when i was working with with dean at kxp
00:58:37 on
00:58:38 this whole class i i learned that you
00:58:41 happen to be
00:58:42 an insane
00:58:45 spirited and an accomplished karaoke
00:58:48 singer
00:58:49 and i think our audience would
00:58:52 appreciate
00:58:53 nothing more well look at this
00:58:59 mark just crawled on uh thank you you
00:59:01 know
00:59:02 um how convenient do you think do you
00:59:05 think you could close us out
00:59:07 with uh your first live performance
00:59:11 since 2008 when you were the lead singer
00:59:13 of the broken knives
00:59:14 uh first because i've done a lot of
00:59:16 karaoke but that yeah but this
00:59:18 is different this is not a karaoke bar
