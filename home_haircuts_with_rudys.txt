00:05:42 place where you're just let's cut some
00:05:43 hair and move on then
00:05:45 we welcome you i want to i want to
00:05:46 welcome elisha and amanda here so
00:05:48 um these two ladies have been running
00:05:50 kayla's community college behind the
00:05:52 scenes
00:05:52 to include our financing restaurant that
00:05:54 we shut down a little bit ago
00:05:55 um in lieu of doing something a little
00:05:57 more creative in these unusual times so
00:05:59 uh thank you this is so cool to have you
00:06:01 guys
00:06:02 with us um so you're going to cut your
00:06:05 own hair
00:06:06 so i'm representing the own hair haircut
00:06:10 dilemma that yes for this i'm
00:06:12 representing the male haircut
00:06:14 as cut by a trusted person yes
00:06:17 who doesn't know what she's doing you
00:06:18 have no idea you come in here once
00:06:20 during covert and it went very poorly
00:06:22 brian actually came in the next day and
00:06:24 i was there is it true that there was
00:06:25 some marital tension around the haircut
00:06:30 so the tension was she did it and then i
00:06:32 tried to fix it because i could do it
00:06:34 better and i made it way worse
00:06:36 yeah i cleaned my own hair wow
00:06:41 yeah just accept it yeah
00:06:45 elisha have you ever had your hair cut
00:06:47 by amanda
00:06:48 what's the story here no we just uh
00:06:51 volunteered
00:06:52 and i said i would do it because she
00:06:54 definitely didn't want me cutting her
00:06:55 hair
00:06:56 so so amanda you've cut a hair or two of
00:06:59 my own it didn't go well but um they say
00:07:03 not somebody else's head so good luck
00:07:04 alicia that's gonna be great
00:07:06 so if you're feeling alone in this
00:07:08 moment you're not um
00:07:10 because in particular we put uh you know
00:07:13 home haircut with rudy's
00:07:14 early on in the syllabus of kansas
00:07:16 community college just to put it all on
00:07:18 the line because we're going to be
00:07:20 doing live streams for the next seven
00:07:21 weeks i've never thought of that
00:07:25 it's like a streak in my hair so here's
00:07:27 what we want you to do at home we want
00:07:29 you
00:07:30 to grab whatever beverage that you would
00:07:32 typically cut hair with we've all got
00:07:33 one here
00:07:34 we want you to grab any equipment that
00:07:37 you would have at home
00:07:38 obviously that's where you are we've all
00:07:40 brought our own home
00:07:41 haircutting equipment in and um
00:07:44 and we also have sort of improvised uh
00:07:47 so just so you know what's happening
00:07:48 here at the canal studios which used to
00:07:50 be dining room
00:07:50 we have sheets on the ground uh to keep
00:07:53 the hair up i would recommend cutting
00:07:55 hair in a shower or bathtub
00:07:56 or actually actually sheets are great
00:07:59 sheets yeah it's easy
00:08:00 or on carpet where you could vacuum or
00:08:02 somewhere where you can sweep up
00:08:04 it doesn't really matter it doesn't
00:08:05 really matter it doesn't matter you're
00:08:06 gonna have a cleanup regardless okay
00:08:08 cool um so i think that's first and
00:08:10 foremost i think having something to
00:08:12 cover yourself whether it be a trash bag
00:08:14 or
00:08:15 you know some other linens or a poncho
00:08:18 tablecloth
00:08:18 i think yeah not everyone has the fancy
00:08:21 barber
00:08:21 we don't that's right and we don't have
00:08:23 them so we're gonna use what we found
00:08:25 around the restaurant
00:08:26 right so i have a crab shack i have a
00:08:28 crab shack poncho
00:08:30 that i'll be using and i'm gonna put the
00:08:32 hood inside so
00:08:34 my neck gets exposed and then and you
00:08:36 guys go on with how we're gonna
00:08:37 tablecloth
00:08:38 basically why don't we just do this
00:08:40 right now i feel like i feel like we
00:08:41 should
00:08:42 probably all right we should probably go
00:08:43 there once um
00:08:45 whoever gets uh dressed up first
00:08:48 and ready to go let's have a quick
00:08:50 little talk through consultation of what
00:08:52 we're doing
00:09:02 for halloween are you sure that's not a
00:09:05 120 this is it all right
00:09:07 okay you guys look ready yeah oh we're
00:09:09 yeah okay
00:09:11 so so with your tools what is it that
00:09:13 we're working with today
00:09:16 okay yeah we got some are these tiffany
00:09:20 yes those are so pretty i didn't know
00:09:23 tiffany made flippers
00:09:24 okay we've got a big comb we have a
00:09:27 thinning shear staining shears yep
00:09:29 and some real scissors and where is what
00:09:32 is this thing that you have here
00:09:34 oh you know it just helps make the
00:09:36 haircut easier okay it's a big comb
00:09:38 yeah massive comb yeah well let's start
00:09:40 with
00:09:41 this you you bought this on amazon for
00:09:42 having any more of these um
00:09:44 it's supposed to be good for little kids
00:09:45 because it's quieter so it doesn't scare
00:09:47 them
00:09:48 okay let's find out what is it that you
00:09:51 guys are hoping to do today
00:09:53 uh just like screwing up like a tapered
00:09:55 cut okay
00:09:56 that looks clean okay and
00:10:00 intentionally intentional intentional
00:10:02 okay and i like to not
00:10:04 spend time on my hair okay in the
00:10:05 morning i take a shower
00:10:07 i want to put one little double of
00:10:09 something and then go like this and walk
00:10:11 up
00:10:11 walk out the door okay you can attest to
00:10:13 this yeah but he's had this funny
00:10:15 kind of comb over thing okay
00:10:18 we'll worry about the top let's focus on
00:10:21 the sides okay so let's break this down
00:10:22 and like
00:10:23 the top we leave alone the sides we
00:10:25 focus on first so i'd find your longest
00:10:27 guard
00:10:30 that's it yeah maybe this is it i'll let
00:10:33 you
00:10:33 put it together okay and all you're
00:10:35 going to do is you're going to take the
00:10:36 longest guard
00:10:37 and you're going to go from temple all
00:10:40 the way around his head
00:10:42 go all the way do i curve like that yep
00:10:44 all the way down because you don't want
00:10:45 to go
00:10:46 too high you're going to cut into his
00:10:47 crown he's going to look like he's been
00:10:48 dropped on the top of his head this
00:10:50 way you go straight up and rock out
00:10:53 straight up and rock out
00:10:55 okay all right here we go
00:10:58 this looks great that is awesome
00:11:02 yeah you are covered to the gills um all
00:11:05 we want to do is make sure for longer
00:11:06 hair
00:11:07 that this cape is a little tucked in so
00:11:11 it's a flatter surface around the neck
00:11:13 so the flatter the surface the smoother
00:11:15 the haircut all right
00:11:17 so i'll let you do that
00:11:22 okay all right
00:11:25 you're in you're in you're good okay
00:11:28 so so what's your overall goal to look
00:11:31 like you
00:11:32 okay oh yeah right or even just even
00:11:35 just like fraction of
00:11:36 the coolest oh yeah right my goal is
00:11:38 sort of kind of
00:11:39 i'll be honest i kind of i kind of don't
00:11:42 have a hair spot if i do that every
00:11:44 morning
00:11:44 okay too long it's way too long
00:11:46 everything's shorter okay
00:11:48 um how do you like the length on the
00:11:49 sides it's a little long it's a little
00:11:51 long
00:11:52 you clearly are used to doing this yeah
00:11:55 okay
00:11:55 so what all i want you to do is do the
00:11:57 sides on both
00:11:59 do both sides like you have been doing
00:12:01 because this looks good okay
00:12:02 so you just keep doing this first do
00:12:05 those first
00:12:06 and then i'll walk you through the back
00:12:08 okay
00:12:17 normally i'm the guy on the computer
00:12:19 that is absolutely right answering
00:12:21 questions you keep doing that
00:12:27 we're also going to treat this as like a
00:12:29 barber shop ask me anything
00:12:31 if you have any question related to
00:12:34 anything
00:12:34 not just haircut related but cobid
00:12:37 related or canvas related or
00:12:39 the last fight that mackenzie and i got
00:12:41 in related
00:12:43 i would like to know about the last
00:12:44 round and i think that's a good place to
00:12:46 start and natasha
00:12:47 will weed through some questions in the
00:12:49 barbershop conversation
00:12:51 getting a lot of questions and we can
00:12:52 get to this about the fade how to fade
00:12:54 between
00:12:55 using the machine versus scissors
00:12:58 and how to blend okay uh
00:13:01 typically that just comes down to your
00:13:03 proper tools so
00:13:04 if you buy any um
00:13:08 clipper brand on online with an
00:13:10 adjustable clipper
00:13:12 they have big plastic guards so you just
00:13:15 want to start at the longest guard
00:13:16 sometimes those go all the way up to uh
00:13:19 six and you just want to cut as far into
00:13:22 the this is called the parietal ridge
00:13:24 which is right around
00:13:26 the curvature of your head you want to
00:13:28 cut straight up past
00:13:29 that all the way through with the
00:13:33 longest guard and then slowly work your
00:13:34 way down
00:13:35 and it can be what device are you using
00:13:37 okay so with long hair this is one made
00:13:40 for
00:13:40 this is something that actually doesn't
00:13:42 need to be very difficult
00:13:44 so from so much hair in your top of the
00:13:47 ear
00:13:48 to top of the ear i want you to take a
00:13:50 second and take everything else out and
00:13:52 put it on the top of her head
00:13:53 okay does your hair fall in your drawer
00:13:55 for a little tip
00:13:56 so it doesn't appear that yeah yeah i
00:13:58 think it's a little more
00:13:59 that's super smart
00:14:02 [Laughter]
00:14:19 is there anything you'd recommend don't
00:14:21 go don't go higher
00:14:22 than the curvature of your head which is
00:14:24 like so so right up
00:14:26 in in this area right there so you're
00:14:28 just you're just wanting to go above the
00:14:30 ear
00:14:31 and then go straight back because right
00:14:34 now what you are
00:14:35 rocking is a beautiful 80s mullet and
00:14:38 we're just going to try and refine that
00:14:40 so you don't have much more people in my
00:14:42 life who love me
00:14:42 would love it if we could fix the 80s
00:14:45 moment okay
00:14:46 i like people in my life who i like who
00:14:48 are hoping that i i've missed that
00:14:50 opportunity
00:14:51 i love how you're going scissor over
00:14:53 comb all the way
00:14:54 all the way back like it's old school is
00:14:56 this old school yeah it is i feel like
00:14:57 this is authentic i'm going to hire you
00:14:59 i don't want to next week i'm not doing
00:15:01 next week i'm full-on yeah i like the
00:15:03 sound of the scissors
00:15:04 it feels good looks good i'm getting a
00:15:07 question
00:15:07 about how to cut long hair
00:15:11 as a woman on yourself how to cut your
00:15:14 own hair
00:15:15 okay you're going to want to divide your
00:15:17 head
00:15:18 in a couple different sections typically
00:15:21 you want to create some sort of your
00:15:23 your guideline or your baseline of what
00:15:25 your length is going
00:15:26 to be so i would recommend
00:15:29 from the top of your ear to the top of
00:15:30 your ear in the back
00:15:32 and i would pull that over your
00:15:34 shoulders i'd separate it evenly in the
00:15:36 middle
00:15:37 and pull it over your shoulders and just
00:15:39 cut everything that you can see at the
00:15:40 length that you want
00:15:42 and i would then take another section
00:15:44 from
00:15:45 uh above your temple to your crown
00:15:49 pull that down and do the same thing
00:15:51 until you found the guide that you want
00:15:53 when it comes to cutting layers it
00:15:54 becomes a whole different strategy
00:15:57 um that you're going to have to kind of
00:16:00 pick
00:16:00 and torque your hand and your head up to
00:16:03 kind of get the angle do you even
00:16:04 attempt a layer at home
00:16:06 that's it that's a very dangerous thing
00:16:08 to do okay i would not recommend it
00:16:11 i mean i can coach you through it but i
00:16:13 would not recommend it
00:16:15 yeah but say covet goes like a while
00:16:18 longer
00:16:18 and you really just want to layer cause
00:16:20 you've got time to grow it out if you
00:16:22 make
00:16:22 you do yeah i mean yeah i think we're
00:16:24 going to be seeing a lot of stuff we're
00:16:26 calling
00:16:26 a lot of buzz cuts and we're going to be
00:16:28 seeing a lot of bobs running around here
00:16:30 and on on yes you can on zoom
00:16:33 they only see the front of your face
00:16:34 anyway it's so true you don't say the
00:16:37 same
00:16:37 one you're just gonna go a little bit
00:16:39 lower
00:16:40 the same shorter one with the next step
00:16:43 down so
00:16:44 if you have whatever that guard is
00:16:46 you're gonna flip it around and use that
00:16:48 next that next guard and you're just
00:16:50 going to go just
00:16:51 below that yeah you're just doing a
00:16:54 horseshoe like a horseshoe you're going
00:16:56 just below the next horseshoe
00:16:57 got a question for brian and mark what
00:16:59 is the thing that you argue about the
00:17:02 most
00:17:05 do we do we argue mckenzie would know
00:17:08 this probably better than women
00:17:10 actually amanda and misha would know
00:17:12 that
00:17:15 you know it's a it's a great question
00:17:18 some part of me thinks
00:17:19 we argue maybe less like natasha you're
00:17:22 one of our newest members of our team
00:17:25 i'll be management team yeah do you do
00:17:27 you think do we argue you
00:17:30 less i think most people think we fight
00:17:32 more than we actually do
00:17:34 no there are far more concessions on a
00:17:36 regular basis yeah
00:17:37 i think we generally get along but the
00:17:40 time i think when we have the most
00:17:42 tension
00:17:43 i'm more of a realist and mark is more
00:17:45 of a dreamer that is for sure and i
00:17:47 think both those things are really
00:17:49 important
00:17:49 in a company except when i'm dreaming i
00:17:52 really don't want to know
00:17:54 what you think is real life i just want
00:17:56 to like yeah so i have to be careful not
00:17:58 to always
00:17:59 rain on his parade but sometimes his
00:18:02 parade
00:18:02 needs to be rained out quickly and so
00:18:05 there's a there's often
00:18:06 um i get exhausted by mark's crazy
00:18:10 vision so now what i want you to do
00:18:11 and because i just want him to here i've
00:18:13 already cut to the end of the story and
00:18:15 i know it's not possible
00:18:16 but at the same time mark believes that
00:18:18 things are possible but i would never
00:18:20 get a chance to do that
00:18:21 so it's a good it's a good union
00:18:26 yeah like
00:18:28 like that yeah brian that's a great
00:18:30 answer but jesse just gave me a great
00:18:32 trick
00:18:32 for cut cutting oh jesse tip
00:18:35 the back teach us would you just teach
00:18:38 me there we go
00:18:39 it's just it's just an angle situation
00:18:41 angle i'm i'm right-handed cutting on
00:18:43 the left side of the back
00:18:45 you're almost at this point because how
00:18:47 low you are
00:18:48 yeah i think we need to get rid of the
00:18:49 comb i need to just
00:18:51 yep and i'm just gonna wow now what
00:18:53 you're gonna do is to use
00:18:55 you're going to you're going to use that
00:18:57 yep your hand as a comb okay
00:18:59 and you're just going to feel and you're
00:19:00 just going to go all the way
00:19:02 over like this and feel the top of your
00:19:05 finger there no way
00:19:06 and you're just going to trim along see
00:19:08 feel that yes you're just going to cut
00:19:10 all of that that's my finger well yeah
00:19:12 you're not going to cut into your finger
00:19:14 you're cutting what you're saying is put
00:19:16 the scissors on my finger and then just
00:19:17 move them slightly off of my finger
00:19:20 all right all right this is um there you
00:19:22 go there you go the last time i
00:19:24 ever used these fingers nope you're good
00:19:26 you're like i'm not cutting hair jesse i
00:19:27 don't feel like that when
00:19:28 i go this way there you go there you go
00:19:29 perfect perfect okay yep
00:19:31 oh i can do this whatever you can do oh
00:19:33 yeah got it yeah is that working
00:19:36 yep
00:19:38 you can also do this oh oh yeah
00:19:41 feel it that way so much more
00:19:42 comfortable all right i'm gonna get into
00:19:44 this and actually
00:19:45 do this put your head down okay and then
00:19:47 you can just relax
00:19:48 relax your neck and just grab your yep
00:19:51 grab your hair
00:19:52 and then just go ahead and trim it i'm
00:19:55 looking for hair
00:19:58 hair right there oh my gosh that was a
00:20:00 lot of air
00:20:02 i have a question so i missed it earlier
00:20:05 when you cut
00:20:06 long hair yeah do you always pin it up
00:20:09 like she's doing
00:20:10 yeah it's easier to control because if
00:20:11 you try tackling all of this hair at
00:20:13 once you're just going to get lost
00:20:15 and you're going to end up with
00:20:16 something beautiful and asymmetrical
00:20:18 it's just gonna happen sometimes he is
00:20:20 asymmetrical that's right
00:20:21 that's right but i don't think today
00:20:23 that's what we were going for okay
00:20:25 jesse i've got some specific hair
00:20:27 questions okay
00:20:28 first though someone said this is way
00:20:30 better than the debates you're just
00:20:31 gonna get
00:20:42 oh yeah he was getting she was getting
00:20:44 trashed um just like that
00:20:46 kristen is cutting her husband's hair
00:20:48 and has an eight should she go
00:20:49 down to a seven or down to a six she
00:20:52 should go
00:20:53 she should vote she should go are they
00:20:54 adjustable clippers
00:20:56 kristen are they adjustable we're
00:20:58 waiting to here okay
00:21:00 if they're adjustable go to a six and
00:21:02 open them up all the way
00:21:04 because that's close to a seven and it
00:21:06 allows you to kind of blend yourself
00:21:07 back down
00:21:09 okay you can go to the next one okay yes
00:21:12 and at this point you're gonna go
00:21:13 straight down how much shorter are you
00:21:16 planning on taking this
00:21:17 i want to go to a three okay that's what
00:21:19 i tell the barber okay
00:21:20 what number which i i i have no idea
00:21:24 i have no idea regardless it's gonna be
00:21:27 fantastic i would say six is probably
00:21:31 where we want to be six millimeters and
00:21:33 so at that point
00:21:35 your main focus is going to be from the
00:21:37 top of the ear
00:21:38 to the temple you're gonna clean
00:21:40 sideburn up okay and then you're gonna
00:21:42 and then you're gonna clean this stuff
00:21:43 up and then you're going to go straight
00:21:45 across the nape
00:21:46 like that does that make sense
00:21:49 so you're going to just came off your
00:21:50 head well you're going to do the same
00:21:52 rotation
00:21:52 but you're going to go from basically
00:21:54 middle of the ear to middle of the ear
00:21:55 so it's going to
00:21:56 that's going
00:22:06 okay go for it when cutting women's hair
00:22:08 should it be dry or damp
00:22:10 um it depends on your texture repeat the
00:22:12 question um
00:22:14 if regardless of the texture
00:22:18 it either needs to be all wet or
00:22:21 completely dry
00:22:22 i think doing a half and half is never
00:22:25 gonna it's never gonna work out for you
00:22:26 because
00:22:27 if it is half wet um
00:22:30 when it does dry some of it's gonna
00:22:32 shrink up and some of it's not so it's
00:22:34 gonna totally be uneven
00:22:35 um it depends on if you plan on
00:22:39 texturizing your hair as well so if you
00:22:41 plan on doing any slide cutting with
00:22:43 whatever kitchen shears you have um that
00:22:46 on wet hair is much better than on dry
00:22:48 hair
00:22:49 yeah okay so you have trimmed that
00:22:52 right yeah so then what i would do is
00:22:55 your your next section which
00:22:56 let's go from temple all the way around
00:22:59 the head in a big horseshoe again
00:23:01 and we'll pull all that stuff down and
00:23:03 we'll just leave the top of her head all
00:23:05 tied up okay jesse everybody trying to
00:23:08 get hair
00:23:08 in between these fingers you could do
00:23:11 fingers
00:23:12 you could just grab you could take these
00:23:14 two fingers right here and just grab
00:23:16 hair
00:23:16 okay and leave the rest of your palms
00:23:19 and when i can't
00:23:20 and leave the rest of your palm on your
00:23:22 on your head
00:23:23 so you're just almost almost just
00:23:25 getting these yep just grab those two
00:23:27 fingers
00:23:28 rather than kind of having all your
00:23:29 fingers in there confusing me a little
00:23:31 bit yeah
00:23:32 okay is that better better yeah okay
00:23:34 okay and then
00:23:35 you just kind of keep cutting at that
00:23:37 length and that'll be either work that
00:23:39 that looks good
00:23:40 no way wait it's good just keep doing
00:23:42 this yep you just keep going
00:23:43 and it's just gonna work it's gonna work

00:23:49 bonding moment for society having said
00:23:51 that

00:25:24 great thank you mckenzie this might be a
00:25:27 question for you tips for cutting
00:25:28 toddler hair how to get them to hold
00:25:30 still okay
00:25:31 i gotta get it i set up all that we'll
00:25:34 get to that we'll get that yeah don't
00:25:36 don't get yeah
00:25:37 yeah don't worry about that i need to
00:25:38 say you just keep focusing on that
00:25:40 there's more hair
00:25:41 there's no lollipop takes a long time
00:25:46 how old is your son he will be three at
00:25:49 the end
00:25:49 of november and he does really well with
00:25:53 it
00:25:54 it's more my lack of skills that's the
00:25:58 problem
00:26:00 i have a question about a bang trim on a
00:26:02 woman any good
00:26:04 method that keeps someone from looking
00:26:06 like a fifth grader
00:26:07 do you have things already
00:26:11 i would assume yes okay so um
00:26:14 depending on the style of bangs that you
00:26:17 have
00:26:18 if you have short bangs that are
00:26:21 above your eyebrows you can section
00:26:25 those
00:26:25 those bangs out and you can pull
00:26:28 everything to the middle part of
00:26:32 in between your eyes just above your
00:26:33 eyebrows and you can you can bring
00:26:35 everything together and take one snip
00:26:37 and
00:26:37 it you'll give that perfect kind of
00:26:39 curtain bang
00:26:40 for any side swept bang so if you have
00:26:43 let's say a part on your
00:26:46 left side and everything goes to your
00:26:48 right
00:26:49 you are going to take apart on your
00:26:52 right side
00:26:53 and you're going to pull everything to
00:26:55 the point
00:26:57 um where you want the shortest part and
00:26:59 you're going to cut that
00:27:00 and everything will drag and you'll have
00:27:02 a sweeping bang moving the other
00:27:04 direction
00:27:06 opposite for a right part
00:27:10 i'm getting some follow-up questions on
00:27:11 slide cutting and a horseshoe they have
00:27:13 no idea what it means and would love
00:27:15 yours a horseshoe section
00:27:18 is just something that goes all the way
00:27:20 around the head starts on one side
00:27:22 ends on the other it's just an easy way
00:27:24 to kind of
00:27:25 um separate the head so you're not
00:27:27 working with so much product at once
00:27:30 or so much product so much hair at once
00:27:32 what's
00:27:34 it's like uh that was a horseshoe right
00:27:36 a slide cut is just something that you
00:27:38 would do to remove weight
00:27:40 so example i want to take some weight
00:27:43 right here i'm going to use some
00:27:47 shears and i'm going to
00:27:50 insert that insert it in and i'm going
00:27:52 to slowly
00:27:54 slide cut it down to remove some weight
00:27:56 to kind of break up the ends
00:27:58 so it gives me a little texture is that
00:28:00 an advanced move that you don't
00:28:01 recommend for the home barber
00:28:03 you know what if we're already here
00:28:05 we're already here right
00:28:07 it kind of went in right there that's
00:28:09 okay so
00:28:11 as long as we keep grabbing the comb and
00:28:15 going at a horizontal here
00:28:17 we'll be able to kind of cut everything
00:28:18 if we go in like that we could end up
00:28:21 gouging and creating the seahawks logo i
00:28:24 mean gouging isn't the word i was hoping
00:28:26 [Music]
00:28:28 how are we
00:28:32 my hands were getting tired so i
00:28:34 switched to over here okay
00:28:36 i feel like i should have done some
00:28:37 warm-up calisthenics that's okay
00:28:39 i think you got it i was just sort of
00:28:41 like doing the easy stuff i could see
00:28:43 so um i've basically just been cutting
00:28:45 hair that i can't see for the last
00:28:47 15 minutes yeah and i've realized that
00:28:49 you're right-handed
00:28:50 because all of this is cut and nothing
00:28:53 on the left side is cut
00:28:55 got it so you got like this so you got
00:28:57 like this mohawk that comes here and
00:28:58 then it just kind of
00:28:59 tails off behind the ear which is not
00:29:02 like that's not cool
00:29:03 it's cool it's cool it's cool so right
00:29:06 here i need to work on yeah so
00:29:08 what you're gonna do is you're gonna
00:29:09 turn your head over okay and down okay
00:29:12 so it makes it easier for you and you're
00:29:14 just going to grab your hair here
00:29:16 and then this is going to come all the
00:29:18 way over the back
00:29:19 okay let's see if i was cutting my hair
00:29:22 i would do
00:29:25 i would actually i would try to bend
00:29:27 over as far as i could
00:29:28 just to kind of do this motion
00:29:31 does that make sense so if i tip my head
00:29:34 all the way over then i can kind of grab
00:29:36 everything
00:29:37 and do that okay yeah
00:29:51 just grab the chunk and cut it done yeah
00:29:53 just grab the chunk and cut it
00:29:55 how comfortable does that make you feel
00:29:56 yeah well it's great it's going to make
00:29:58 it even
00:30:00 then i totally get it okay so this is
00:30:03 looking fantastic
00:30:05 that's okay it is well it is
00:30:09 it feels like a little heavy rain okay
00:30:13 so there is a question specifically
00:30:14 about blending between the side and the
00:30:16 top
00:30:16 yep can you address that yep we're going
00:30:18 to address that right now
00:30:19 um do you want to grab uh let's get this
00:30:22 water bottle
00:30:23 and let's now you want to do any clipper
00:30:26 work on dry hair
00:30:28 because if you do it on wet hair it's
00:30:29 going to clump up and it's not going to
00:30:31 be even
00:30:31 so i'm done with this you're down you're
00:30:33 done with unless you want
00:30:35 unless you want to clean up the edges
00:30:36 all the way around
00:30:38 which the nice thing about that is it's
00:30:39 not going to cut them so you can just
00:30:42 it won't cut you sir you can just
00:30:44 literally just line it up
00:30:46 okay and go around the ear
00:30:56 and then just yep just a little bit yep
00:30:59 there you go and then
00:31:00 just around the ear just like that
00:31:11 but it's still there i mean the good
00:31:12 news is that it's still there
00:31:14 i mean here's the thing i keep putting
00:31:15 it on my novel to find
00:31:17 yeah okay i keep sort of you know okay
00:31:21 right there my spirits are high yeah
00:31:24 well i feel like i
00:31:24 failed you no no i have you over i heard
00:31:27 you over here just kind of
00:31:28 no no willy nilly it's not you it's me
00:31:32 but um okay just keep going up
00:31:36 up here because if i cut this too short
00:31:38 it sticks nope that's
00:31:39 that's actually good let's focus on the
00:31:42 top now okay
00:31:43 yeah so now you want a little bit of
00:31:46 length that's going to help kind of push
00:31:47 this over right
00:31:48 a little bit okay so let's just kind of
00:31:51 grab
00:31:51 wherever you push it to the left
00:31:55 uh it just it depends like like odd days
00:31:57 i go over here
00:31:58 i make it up everywhere okay so then
00:32:01 let's do this
00:32:02 let's let's act like today we're going
00:32:03 to push it to the left
00:32:05 and we're going to pull everything over
00:32:06 and you're just going to trim this
00:32:08 you want me to cut this right here yep
00:32:11 and then you're just going to trim that
00:32:12 so put your hands in there there's no
00:32:13 rush
00:32:15 it's just act like you're gonna
00:32:18 yeah just like that i can't cut that
00:32:20 right yeah
00:32:21 that's right yet so now i'm at this
00:32:24 point where she has all these
00:32:25 layers going on how do you attempt
00:32:28 trimming layers that are already formed
00:32:30 well the easiest thing to do is because
00:32:34 we're
00:32:35 dealing with a round head
00:32:38 to make things fall evenly if we just
00:32:41 were to pull
00:32:42 everything from
00:32:45 basically the round of the head crown
00:32:48 up and pull everything straight
00:32:52 up and trim everything when it fell down
00:32:56 it would fall in natural have a natural
00:32:59 fall
00:32:59 and we wouldn't leave any sort of
00:33:02 weight line because sometimes if you go
00:33:05 too short on layers we can create a
00:33:07 weight line
00:33:07 okay now so you're saying to trim while
00:33:10 it's up
00:33:10 you're gonna pull everything up okay
00:33:12 you're gonna pull everything up
00:33:15 and you're gonna if you previous haircut
00:33:18 will kind of show you
00:33:20 right there if you just cut a straight
00:33:22 line right there
00:33:25 you can give her
00:33:28 perfect layers just
00:33:31 pull that stuff up right there and
00:33:34 you're just going to go ahead and cut
00:33:36 yeah against my yeah okay right there
00:33:39 wow that's a lot of work wow it's a lot
00:33:41 of hair i gotta make it straight
00:33:43 what don't worry it's not a lot it's not
00:33:45 that much
00:33:46 i'm just like three inches
00:33:49 that's good i mean do i have to be
00:33:51 discriminated back here can i just sort
00:33:53 of
00:33:53 mow it down you can mow it down all
00:33:55 right yeah there's so much
00:33:56 hair okay i think you need to spray it
00:33:58 yeah oh
00:34:00 jesse do you have any tips for thinning
00:34:02 short hair masking areas that are worse
00:34:04 than others
00:34:06 for for thinning hair
00:34:10 i'd say for thinning hair wearing it
00:34:13 shorter is better
00:34:15 i would say for cutting it
00:34:18 you're going to want to cut something
00:34:20 blunt like blunt with no texture which
00:34:23 using these tools that we have here
00:34:24 today is going to leave you
00:34:26 a blunt texture rather than
00:34:30 point cutting into it or using a
00:34:33 razor of some sort which is going to if
00:34:35 i
00:34:36 be more of a texture thing so i would
00:34:38 just
00:34:39 cut everything as uniform as you
00:34:41 possibly can
00:34:42 i think would be the best thing okay
00:34:46 here we are yeah and you have you this
00:34:49 and your oh you want now scissors
00:34:52 spinning
00:34:53 uh nope just normal scissors now i'm
00:34:55 gonna
00:34:56 show you just one time
00:35:00 you can see all that weight right there
00:35:02 right if you stand behind it you can see
00:35:03 where that's getting
00:35:04 yeah so you're gonna find your guide
00:35:06 just below it right there and you're
00:35:08 just gonna
00:35:09 rotate that comb all the way out like
00:35:11 that and just cut a straight line
00:35:14 okay but you're to want to right at this
00:35:16 part of the head
00:35:17 you're not going to want to follow head
00:35:18 shape you're going to want to go
00:35:20 straight out from that in that direction
00:35:22 stop here
00:35:23 until you run out of hair okay as long
00:35:26 as you run out of hair
00:35:27 you're fine okay so she specifically
00:35:31 well first what do you think i think
00:35:34 that looks really good that's great
00:35:36 i think it looks really good i think the
00:35:37 only thing i would do at this point is i
00:35:39 would find where that layer falls
00:35:41 right there's a little bit of a gap
00:35:43 there so i would then
00:35:45 pull that out and i would use my shears
00:35:48 and i'd cut down like that
00:35:49 okay and that blends out any of the
00:35:52 layers
00:35:53 beautiful and then she'll do um straight
00:35:55 across bangs
00:35:56 okay so that's what she's looking for
00:35:58 yeah okay can i make this shorter right
00:35:59 here
00:36:00 um is it does it want to be long you
00:36:03 don't want to cut i don't want to yeah
00:36:04 you don't want to cut that little
00:36:05 shirt cut it
00:36:08 got it no no no nothing
00:36:11 i feel like this is just well here just
00:36:13 put your hands back here and just kind
00:36:15 of trim it yeah right there
00:36:17 okay yeah trust me no i'll do that yeah
00:36:19 better all right
00:36:21 i don't trust me okay i feel like you
00:36:23 should for any particular reason but if
00:36:24 i just kind of like
00:36:26 yeah sometimes when we look in the
00:36:27 mirror it makes it really difficult
00:36:29 right
00:36:29 yeah so do this i know it's gonna sound
00:36:31 crazy put your hands
00:36:33 in your hair no no no no close your eyes
00:36:36 okay
00:36:37 and now just feel where the scissors are
00:36:40 and just trim you you literally just
00:36:42 told me to use the force
00:36:44 yeah yeah basically it would be helpful
00:36:46 to me yeah while i'm doing this my
00:36:47 clothes you just whispered
00:36:49 use the force yeah just it is easier
00:36:53 with your eyes closed it is because when
00:36:55 you stare at yourself in the mirror
00:36:56 it's like you're seeing reverse and
00:36:58 that's when knuckles get lost still yeah
00:37:00 well
00:37:00 i've done it already once it's just no
00:37:03 it's way easier
00:37:04 so much easier just close your eyes
00:37:11 look at the growth pattern so comb it as
00:37:13 it's going to naturally lay
00:37:15 so it's the part is always a little bit
00:37:17 okay so we're gonna we're gonna grow it
00:37:19 we're gonna just comb it and it's
00:37:20 natural okay anything in the back
00:37:23 in the crown area calyx we want to grow
00:37:26 it or
00:37:27 comb it and the way it naturally wants
00:37:28 to lay before we start cutting it i
00:37:30 think i got a few back there and then
00:37:32 you just do the same thing okay okay
00:37:35 question
00:37:36 uh joan and eric would like to know how
00:37:39 to cut around a cowlick on men's hair to
00:37:41 keep it from sticking straight up
00:37:43 leave more length leave more length the
00:37:46 shorter you take it
00:37:47 um the more it's going to pop so
00:37:50 wherever it is around that's making
00:37:52 the length that it is that keeps it
00:37:55 laying down
00:37:56 keep it there that's what i just did
00:37:59 right
00:37:59 yeah that's the cowlick but we also left
00:38:02 length there so it lays down great
00:38:04 yep and then you just kind of keep
00:38:05 walking around the side of his head
00:38:12 so you have it so easy because it's kind
00:38:14 of free form you just get to kind of
00:38:15 like pick things up
00:38:17 and grab things and and look at it and
00:38:20 trim it
00:38:22 for real how are you doing i'm just i'm
00:38:26 going i'm gonna be honest
00:38:27 you're going you're broke okay when i
00:38:30 went like this it looked like there was
00:38:31 a big
00:38:32 tuck well no it's because you cut a hole
00:38:34 into your head you know that there's a
00:38:36 difference yeah
00:38:37 there's a difference between the hole
00:38:38 yeah the difference between a tuft and
00:38:40 you think that i could that i could cut
00:38:43 everything else
00:38:44 shorter to make up for do you want
00:38:45 clippers no no i feel like that no i'm
00:38:48 old school
00:38:49 okay yeah you are that's cool with
00:38:50 clippers you're saying we could just
00:38:52 even that yeah we could even it out
00:38:53 i feel like i could go shorter around
00:38:54 the whole this is the home right here
00:38:56 yep that's a hole just leave it alone
00:38:57 okay just leave it a little bit
00:38:59 just leave it alone i'd say the only
00:39:01 thing right now that you'd want to focus
00:39:03 on
00:39:04 is we'll see
00:39:07 this side's looking good okay this is
00:39:09 the side that's looking a little
00:39:10 uh looking a little choppy what do i do
00:39:12 with that so
00:39:14 hand like that you're going to go
00:39:17 straight
00:39:17 up and right yep right there and you're
00:39:20 just going to cut
00:39:21 right there all right here we go coming
00:39:23 in
00:39:24 look at knuckles watch out knuckles
00:39:26 watch out and then you're going to go
00:39:27 straight back do the same thing again
00:39:29 it's just about kind of consistency
00:39:31 you're just kind of creating that shape
00:39:33 all the way back
00:39:33 all right one more time what about this
00:39:36 donnie yep there you go right it didn't
00:39:38 seem like it yeah yeah so go with your
00:39:40 gut you're saying yeah i see something
00:39:42 it's just it's like if it's not feeling
00:39:44 right cut it like you feel
00:39:46 like what about this don't you think
00:39:47 that should go that should go
00:39:49 yeah i didn't realize that those
00:39:52 scissors that you have are so sharp you
00:39:53 know i got these scissors off the
00:39:55 internet
00:39:56 and they were not expensive i think i
00:39:58 paid like forty dollars for three
00:40:00 different
00:40:00 kids and we use the rest in the kitchen
00:40:03 they just kind of work
00:40:04 yeah this is my knife
00:40:07 i think can you sharpen your scissors is
00:40:09 that a thing do i sharpen them yeah yeah
00:40:12 about
00:40:12 every six to eight months
00:40:16 okay okay so right now you have a little
00:40:18 bit of a duck tail here but that's kind
00:40:19 of
00:40:20 normal so you're gonna put your head
00:40:22 down okay and you're going to act like
00:40:23 you're going to cut a straight line just
00:40:25 across your
00:40:25 your neck but the first thing you're
00:40:26 going to do is once again is using the
00:40:28 brush yeah yep you're going to take your
00:40:30 hand
00:40:30 and you're going to come straight down
00:40:32 and to where you run okay right there
00:40:34 and we're going to use this
00:40:35 yeah and come straight back behind and
00:40:37 let me go straight across go ahead cuz
00:40:38 this is that line
00:40:39 no way i'm cutting i'm cutting i'm
00:40:40 cutting no way are you sure
00:40:42 yeah right there that's okay
00:40:46 you didn't cut it gonna kill that cut it
00:40:48 again cut it again all right
00:40:49 all right i'm cutting okay
00:40:52 there's been a comment on the youtube
00:40:54 channel that you need to come sit in my
00:40:56 chair for repairs
00:40:57 yeah oh for sure now freehanded now
00:41:00 freehand
00:41:00 okay okay how do i know where the line
00:41:03 is i got you
00:41:04 okay you're just going to go ahead and
00:41:05 go there you go there is a question
00:41:07 about how do you keep a straight level
00:41:08 line while cutting
00:41:10 your own hair um and jessie
00:41:13 in in the back um you're going to want
00:41:16 to use your fingers so
00:41:17 typically how i would do things is i
00:41:19 would run my hand
00:41:21 down my neck and then i would cut
00:41:24 and then i would turn my head and follow
00:41:27 that line
00:41:27 and cut and then turn my head and follow
00:41:30 that line
00:41:30 and cut i feel like this part is not
00:41:33 cool okay i need a little
00:41:36 this am i still cutting up to this
00:41:39 well now we're getting into some good
00:41:40 length so now we can downsize into
00:41:42 another comb
00:41:43 do you have another comb i do okay i
00:41:46 mean
00:41:46 a little foam that's perfect okay that's
00:41:48 perfect okay so what you're gonna do now
00:41:51 is you're gonna make a you're gonna
00:41:53 section from the crown
00:41:55 all the way right to the top like right
00:41:58 in the recession we call that the
00:42:00 recession okay
00:42:02 brand new okay you're gonna go ahead and
00:42:05 isn't that a receding hair is that like
00:42:07 a reason no everybody has a recession
00:42:08 it's just a page
00:42:10 and then doing this sound shady um
00:42:13 does all this normally when styling does
00:42:16 everything go that direction
00:42:18 yes right yes everything goes this
00:42:22 direction yes
00:42:23 unless it's versus like parting in the
00:42:25 middle well it's but is there
00:42:26 do you always feel that there's more
00:42:28 length here that there's always the kind
00:42:29 of a disconnect if it falls this way in
00:42:31 the morning do you feel like you have
00:42:33 some overhang
00:42:34 yeah i don't like it falling that way at
00:42:35 all but does it but is there an overhang
00:42:38 is this hair longer than the short part
00:42:40 of the throat here that's all connected
00:42:42 no it's all connected
00:42:43 okay all just goes this way okay okay so
00:42:45 you're gonna make a section from
00:42:47 crown to recession yeah and pull
00:42:50 everything
00:42:51 this way yeah okay too far
00:42:54 no no that's fine okay
00:43:00 and you are going to put your fingers in
00:43:03 here okay
00:43:03 and this is your guide right there so
00:43:05 you're just going to cut that now i'm
00:43:06 going to pull that
00:43:07 you're just well you can you can make a
00:43:09 section if you wanted to
00:43:11 and do that great you just want to get
00:43:14 your fingers in there
00:43:15 right there and cut that and then do it
00:43:17 again and again usually
00:43:18 how are you picking that length because
00:43:20 that's where we
00:43:21 we've already trimmed this is our bottom
00:43:23 guide right there okay yeah
00:43:26 all right can you do anything i feel
00:43:29 like i'm ready for bed
00:43:30 unless you say otherwise i'll listen to
00:43:32 you but okay let's section out
00:43:34 all the bangs first you go ahead and
00:43:36 section out everything
00:43:38 that you feel would be the bangs
00:43:43 you're still going rogue over here i'm
00:43:45 just trying to get all of this
00:43:46 done okay so you're gonna you're gonna
00:43:48 turn your hand this way okay
00:43:50 and you're just gonna just come down
00:43:52 you're to cut right behind your ear
00:43:57 let's see remember jedi force yes close
00:44:00 your eyes
00:44:01 no way close your eyes oh boy okay now
00:44:03 go
00:44:04 go oh yes
00:44:08 okay see that yeah
00:44:11 okay now you can do the same thing on
00:44:13 the other side
00:44:14 over here yep it's easier right yeah
00:44:17 yep and you see you get you exactly
00:44:19 where you want to be okay you're feeling
00:44:21 your scissors are on the head looking
00:44:22 where i want to be with
00:44:23 with my uh in the mirror and then you
00:44:25 close your eyes
00:44:27 and you just cut
00:44:32 let's see i know
00:44:36 go ahead you can tell me i've made a
00:44:38 huge mistake nope
00:44:40 kind of kind of i'm using the force i'll
00:44:42 be honest
00:44:44 i don't know how good i am with the
00:44:45 force good someone commented mark that
00:44:48 you're using before spear because you
00:44:50 have princess leia sitting next to you
00:44:57 is that why it's easier i knew i knew
00:44:59 with your hair in front it's more
00:45:00 a little more i don't know i chewbacca
00:45:03 of like it
00:45:04 you're not actually are you going to cut
00:45:05 those into bangs no it's happening
00:45:08 you're doing basically tonight i didn't
00:45:10 know oh first the canvas tattoo and now
00:45:12 the thing is that's just like a big week
00:45:15 you don't have surprises no one would
00:45:16 good yeah i would do the same thing
00:45:19 minus this on that side okay i would
00:45:21 just skip over the back area it's so
00:45:23 good to know
00:45:24 and then skip the cowlick you leave the
00:45:26 kids just give it up
00:45:28 and then just go ahead and do the same
00:45:29 thing here and cut all that
00:45:32 to the front all the way yeah you can
00:45:34 walk it all the way forward
00:45:36 anything that's remember we section that
00:45:39 out right so only
00:45:40 you're only going to cut half of that
00:45:41 really this part i'm cutting
00:45:44 this is that's all going to be left
00:45:45 alone okay right
00:45:47 so in doing that what that's doing is
00:45:49 creating a guide for us that we'll get
00:45:50 to okay
00:45:51 so just follow that all the way around
00:45:54 okay
00:45:54 okay so bangs typically our corner of
00:45:57 the eyebrow
00:46:13 no no no but do you choose the length of
00:46:14 the bangs or bangs are always a
00:46:16 particular length
00:46:17 no yeah they can be different lengths
00:46:20 i usually do mine a little longer a
00:46:22 little past my eyebrow
00:46:23 a little pasta eyebrow like lower than
00:46:25 my eyebrow into my eyes a little
00:46:27 didn't you have bangs when you first
00:46:28 started working here
00:46:30 that's right when we hired you you had
00:46:31 bangs so that length of hair
00:46:33 is represents your time at campus
00:46:35 restaurant it's a beautiful
00:46:37 representation i'd like to see it that
00:46:39 way you're just freaking
00:46:40 you know it's it's like telling time
00:46:41 with the calendar or with bangs
00:46:43 i've got two different ways you know um
00:46:46 what's fun about
00:46:46 both amanda and at least it's hard to
00:46:48 use the scissors because they were
00:46:49 higher than things
00:46:50 kitchen servers yeah
00:46:58 okay so now that you've done this you
00:47:00 should have with these two
00:47:02 little pieces right here a guide right
00:47:04 in the middle
00:47:05 so you take these two corners and you
00:47:07 bring everything up
00:47:13 and then you do the same thing you move
00:47:14 forward and boop cut that off now if you
00:47:17 if you want that longer boop when you
00:47:20 get to the front you pull it back
00:47:22 okay so you find a point so basically at
00:47:25 the top of the head
00:47:26 right when it starts to round down if
00:47:28 you want longer hair in the front you
00:47:30 pull everything back to that spot where
00:47:32 it starts to round down and that gives
00:47:33 you longer hair
00:47:35 great mark is it true that every
00:47:39 manager at campbell's restaurant of
00:47:40 which there's about 18 i think
00:47:43 except for brady our chef and crystal
00:47:47 our pastry chef these sisters was hired
00:47:49 at the
00:47:50 the bottom rung as a as the entry level
00:47:54 hourly employee including you and me jr
00:47:57 service director was hired as an
00:47:59 expedition
00:48:00 yeah that's true which was still an
00:48:03 hourly employee barista oh yes no let's
00:48:05 see where they all have yes no i think
00:48:07 that
00:48:07 no one was hired as a manager nelson
00:48:10 came in
00:48:10 as a kidney service worked as well yeah
00:48:12 yeah you want to keep it yeah all the
00:48:14 two chefs
00:48:16 just make sure you get it it's an
00:48:18 incredible team including these two who
00:48:20 are not here in line a little bit yeah
00:48:22 right so it's kind of like
00:48:24 dining room okay i'll uh barber shop
00:48:27 since we're actually no i miss our
00:48:29 dining room yeah i know i do too
00:48:30 but they ran the crowd i was asked today
00:48:33 in an interview with the newspaper
00:48:35 i went a little too far no no i just how
00:48:38 it feels to go back
00:48:39 to being a dining room again yeah would
00:48:42 you say
00:48:43 i was surprised to find you doing the
00:48:44 interview with the newspaper just off in
00:48:46 the corner of the restaurant like you
00:48:47 were having something else
00:48:49 and an important newspaper too yeah it's
00:48:50 just because normally you do the
00:48:52 interview
00:48:53 you were very busy because it's been a
00:48:55 busy day yeah
00:48:56 it's been going in a different direction
00:48:58 right um more tension
00:49:00 she said you're gonna go back to being a
00:49:01 normal restaurant again and i said well
00:49:03 we were never really a normal restaurant
00:49:04 no time because we did some crazy things
00:49:06 but you're gonna it's true that we've
00:49:08 gotten to open
00:49:09 one line ten different business models
00:49:12 okay so at her eyeballs here
00:49:14 in one year whereas in the last previous
00:49:17 70 years we've only done one yeah and so
00:49:20 it was
00:49:20 pretty fun to exercise a different set
00:49:22 of muscles than you and i have ever been
00:49:24 able to do before
00:49:25 yeah which is create new businesses like
00:49:28 a college
00:49:38 to just open the diamond floor again and
00:49:40 see everybody i mean even like the
00:49:41 emotional
00:49:43 uh the emotions behind
00:49:47 getting dressed up in suits and then
00:49:49 like welcoming people in
00:49:51 and seeing the space as a dining room
00:49:53 again i think will be
00:49:55 not a little thing for us yeah and for
00:49:58 the staff
00:49:58 and just to see i don't know i'm
00:50:01 presuming we get to the place where you
00:50:02 can hug people again
00:50:03 um but like just we'll get there to
00:50:05 welcome guests in that way i think it's
00:50:07 just gonna be
00:50:08 we've all our our staff has all been a
00:50:10 strict quarantine all together
00:50:16 we miss it yeah we miss our bubble
00:50:18 outside our bubble
00:50:19 outside the bubble yeah the larger
00:50:21 seattle bubble
00:50:22 you guys we talk bangs yeah let's do it
00:50:24 i feel like this is a big moment this is
00:50:25 sort of like the ultimate
00:50:27 okay bangs are a big thing um and
00:50:31 women you can do this at home yourself
00:50:33 as long as you
00:50:34 comb out what you actually want
00:50:37 typically
00:50:38 that's from about corner of the eyebrow
00:50:41 to corner of the eyebrow now depending
00:50:42 on how
00:50:44 how full you want your bangs how dense
00:50:46 you want your bangs
00:50:47 you kind of bring that up depending
00:50:49 we're not going too deep we're kind of
00:50:51 doing a medium bang
00:50:53 so the thing you have to think about is
00:50:55 if you have any sort of calyx or growth
00:50:57 areas there
00:50:58 and because what you're going to do is
00:51:00 you're going to pull everything down
00:51:02 to one spot and you're going to
00:51:06 smooth that out wherever you want them
00:51:08 and then release with tension
00:51:11 so you you release that right on the
00:51:13 cowlick
00:51:14 and then you go ahead and cut it so
00:51:16 typically sometimes it's easier
00:51:18 to start longer than going shorter
00:51:22 so if i start middle of the nose
00:51:25 tip of the nose and then release to the
00:51:28 middle of the nose it gives me a little
00:51:29 bit of wiggle room to kind of just
00:51:31 say again why why release like what's
00:51:33 that guys because
00:51:34 we have a cowlick right here on the
00:51:36 right side so if i pull
00:51:37 tension all the way down and cut that
00:51:40 with tension
00:51:41 this is going to spring up and i'm going
00:51:43 to get this kind of v-shaped bang
00:51:45 or that's really not what we're trying
00:51:47 to do we're trying to do something
00:51:48 that's
00:51:49 straight across got it so in order to
00:51:51 get the straight across you take the
00:51:52 pressure off let the hair do whatever it
00:51:53 wants to do yep
00:51:54 make your cut yeah so i'm going to pull
00:51:56 that down grab the line where i want and
00:51:58 then i'm just going to release a little
00:51:59 bit and then i can cut the line
00:52:02 cool amanda you are you ready for that
00:52:05 i better be not to do it it's going to
00:52:07 be great
00:52:09 but if you have any tips on cutting
00:52:10 curly hair should it be
00:52:12 wet or dry and where on the curl do you
00:52:14 cut
00:52:15 um typically on the curl every
00:52:19 curl pattern is a little bit different
00:52:20 um
00:52:22 bigger curl well i'd say
00:52:26 you want to take almost kind of the same
00:52:28 approach i would always kind of cut
00:52:30 down because cutting up you
00:52:33 have the ability to cut more texture
00:52:35 into the hair
00:52:36 creating more volume so typically
00:52:39 everything that kind of goes
00:52:40 down on the hair is going to help push
00:52:42 the hair down
00:52:43 because you're going to end up cutting
00:52:45 shorter pieces
00:52:46 that end up sliding in the longer pieces
00:52:49 and typically
00:52:50 shorter hair pushes longer hair in
00:52:52 whatever direction it wants to go
00:52:54 so in cutting curly hair cutting
00:52:56 everything down is going to at least
00:52:58 kind of help to kind of keep that down
00:53:01 you might want to take smaller horseshoe
00:53:03 sections
00:53:04 up the head so you have a little bit
00:53:05 more control over it
00:53:08 that might be the easiest thing to do
00:53:10 yeah
00:53:12 are you going to do it i am i just
00:53:14 remember we can always take more hair
00:53:16 away
00:53:16 because those bangs feel a little long
00:53:21 the great thing about this is that you
00:53:23 can now see exactly the shape that
00:53:25 you've kind of done right
00:53:27 so if if this was almost to where you
00:53:29 wanted to be
00:53:30 then you could start taking you could
00:53:33 start kind of grabbing hair like this
00:53:35 and slide cutting it down to kind of get
00:53:38 to just
00:53:39 slowly detail the length of where you
00:53:42 want
00:53:43 obviously we have more weight here so
00:53:44 you're going to have to do that a little
00:53:46 bit more
00:53:47 than on this side okay yeah
00:53:50 um a little bit shorter
00:53:57 it's a little fluffy
00:54:01 well look at it from the front how do
00:54:02 you feel you feel like it's still
00:54:05 does that make you sleep with them do
00:54:07 you want to take me
00:54:08 away um i think it's a tiny bit long
00:54:12 okay so where is it where is it long for
00:54:15 you
00:54:16 [Applause]
00:54:18 maybe is it his ear okay so then just
00:54:21 grab these
00:54:21 that grows out so fast so then grab
00:54:24 these pieces
00:54:25 and just cut that stuff down right like
00:54:27 that because if you like how this is
00:54:29 laying
00:54:30 then don't disrupt that just grab this
00:54:32 stuff and kind of cut that stuff down
00:54:35 now you don't want to cut it too short
00:54:37 there because then all of a sudden
00:54:39 he's going to have something like kind
00:54:41 of that with all this length
00:54:44 so just a little bit just kind of pick a
00:54:45 little bit of this corner up and just
00:54:47 kind of trim
00:54:48 a little bit you're taking you're taking
00:54:50 some length too
00:54:52 yeah so just a little bit at a time
00:54:58 you know i'm wondering you are by far do
00:55:00 you think this is a masterpiece
00:55:01 you think i can you think i can thin my
00:55:03 eyebrows is this how this happens yeah
00:55:05 but you're going to want to
00:55:06 look at this one though you're not going
00:55:08 to want to go jedi
00:55:10 and close and close your eyes let's see
00:55:13 scissors towards the eyeball scissors
00:55:15 towards the eyeballs what have what's
00:55:16 the
00:55:16 what's the eyebrow yeah you know the
00:55:19 easiest thing to do for eyebrows
00:55:21 for all gentlemen yeah your beard
00:55:22 trimmer longest setting
00:55:24 really just take it straight down now
00:55:27 you have to yes
00:55:28 now you have to make sure that you have
00:55:29 a guard on there because it's gonna
00:55:32 if you actually take yeah eyebrow off is
00:55:34 that stain is it standard practice just
00:55:36 take the other one off and just be like
00:55:37 yeah
00:55:39 this is this is what i'm doing today
00:55:40 okay cool this week does hair have a
00:55:42 speed like so if
00:55:43 we're going to make a mistake can we
00:55:44 tell the people watching it's okay hair
00:55:46 grows at this rate and
00:55:48 so judging on your mistake this is how
00:55:50 long it'll take
00:55:51 i mean depend depending on how short
00:55:53 you're going i mean if if it's a
00:55:54 maintenance cut
00:55:55 and you're just kind of keeping things
00:55:56 kind of trimmed which is what we've been
00:55:59 doing with you
00:56:00 right i mean you have about three to
00:56:02 four weeks
00:56:03 before it's like uh i'm back to normal

00:56:16 fall season i can always just be like
00:56:18 hey welcome to
00:56:18 zoom yeah i'm over here today i'm not
00:56:20 gonna let you see the hole
00:56:22 that i cut speaking of mistakes people
00:56:24 want to know what's the worst haircut
00:56:26 mistake you've ever made
00:56:28 worst hair cut mistake i've ever made
00:56:31 for the group and you've dreamed
00:56:35 so many so i mean i want the worst one
00:56:38 you've ever made
00:56:39 okay also the right you're most
00:56:40 responsible for because you're the
00:56:41 trainer of all these
00:56:43 stylists right no i'll i'll tell you
00:56:45 i'll tell you
00:56:46 early in my career i had the opportunity
00:56:49 to work alongside
00:56:51 a lot of really talented talented
00:56:53 stylists
00:56:54 and one of these talented stylists did
00:56:57 this maneuver
00:56:58 that i thought was so cool he took a
00:57:00 blow dryer on women's
00:57:02 on on woman's hair and used it to kind
00:57:05 of
00:57:05 blow the hair up and then in the other
00:57:07 hand with his sheers went in
00:57:09 and like detailed the haircut right
00:57:11 while the hair was blowing why it was
00:57:13 blowing
00:57:14 like just shh like it was like worse
00:57:17 it's like wow yeah so
00:57:20 without asking him what he did i chose
00:57:23 to do this
00:57:24 on a climb a paying client
00:57:27 i was like i'm going to do this and
00:57:29 afterwards he walked up to me and said
00:57:31 what the
00:57:32 f thinking
00:57:35 i was like i saw that move man i had to
00:57:38 do the move he's like
00:57:39 we need a class so uh me and him sat
00:57:42 down we did a little class i
00:57:44 i understood exactly does the move have
00:57:45 a name or did he make it up
00:57:47 no it was i i don't i actually to this
00:57:49 day don't know if the move had a name
00:57:52 okay but it was just so cool to watch
00:57:54 and i i
00:57:55 i felt bad because i never saw that
00:57:56 woman again hey
00:57:58 i have a question i have a question but
00:58:00 um first of all if she's if you're out
00:58:02 there
00:58:02 we can have a little reconciliation
00:58:04 right now so you can call in dial this
00:58:06 number
00:58:07 jesse's here i'm kidding um what about
00:58:09 tipping so in restaurants tipping's a
00:58:11 big deal
00:58:11 uh and we're talking a lot about like um
00:58:14 tipping going away
00:58:15 or the price of service being included
00:58:17 in the meal or a standard service charge
00:58:19 you guys in the same vein right where
00:58:22 it's a really important piece of what a
00:58:23 stylist makes
00:58:24 is that a discussion all in in the world
00:58:27 of hair where it would just be included
00:58:29 or would that ever happen like what is
00:58:31 the
00:58:32 what's sort of the inside take on
00:58:33 tipping right now um like help us tip
00:58:36 well like help us help us know how to do
00:58:38 this you know
00:58:40 i think tipping is such a personal thing
00:58:44 you know because
00:58:45 i think it really comes down to the
00:58:46 client experience if you can provide a
00:58:49 great client experience
00:58:50 and it exceeds the value of what you're
00:58:53 charging them
00:58:54 then chip away um i think for
00:58:58 for our staff i mean you know
00:59:01 they're doing 40 50 haircuts every half
00:59:04 an hour to
00:59:05 an hour and so that extra ten or fifteen
00:59:09 bucks really kind of
00:59:10 like it plays into things that is a
00:59:12 piece of their
00:59:14 um income like they're counting on it
00:59:16 well yeah and
00:59:17 honestly during these times people have
00:59:19 been so generous
00:59:20 i mean people are doubling and tripling
00:59:23 their uh gratuity
00:59:25 and just because they're so happy that
00:59:27 they have an opportunity to go somewhere
00:59:29 that it is safe um and they can kind of
00:59:33 catch up and it's somewhat normal and
00:59:35 we're all
00:59:35 relationally starved anyway yeah yeah so
00:59:37 it feels good another human being
00:59:39 yeah exactly yeah especially the service
00:59:42 of
00:59:42 having a haircut how the bangs the bangs
00:59:46 are looking good
00:59:47 we didn't we didn't go too short on the
00:59:49 cowlick just in these corners right here
00:59:52 i'm just gonna suggest picking up and
00:59:54 slide cutting those down just to kind of
00:59:56 take a little bit of the weight
00:59:58 more on that side than on that side all
01:00:00 right okay
01:00:02 i felt like it looked good but then he
01:00:05 brushes it over the way he does and that
01:00:08 feels kind of poofy
01:00:09 right here yeah great so then pull all
01:00:12 of this down
01:00:13 right here to where it feels poofy and
01:00:17 just point cut into it don't cut that
01:00:20 straight line
01:00:20 cut into it like this to soften it great
01:00:24 all the way across right in this corner
01:00:27 right there just
01:00:28 perfect straight into it okay perfect
01:00:31 perfect
01:00:32 you're a good looking dude thank you hey
