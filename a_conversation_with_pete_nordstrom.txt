00:02:54 by the way
00:02:55 i don't know i don't know i know we
00:02:56 missed this i knew you talked you're
00:02:57 gonna do this with your kids but
00:02:59 if you missed aerobics with the pacific
00:03:01 northwest ballet this morning

00:03:05 this this set has changed it was in
00:03:07 aerobics class
00:03:08 earlier today and so um i want to talk
00:03:10 about creativity a little bit
00:03:12 so yes we're trying to do some things
00:03:13 here that are outside of our comfort
00:03:15 zone
00:03:16 that are uh i if i know nothing about
00:03:19 community college i know even less about
00:03:21 aerobics
00:03:24 you guys this is not the first time
00:03:27 that your 119 year old company has been
00:03:30 through hard times
00:03:31 and i think if you're a seattleite and
00:03:33 you've waved this flag which so many
00:03:35 people watching have you guys are
00:03:38 champions
00:03:38 a little bit in terms of enduring you've
00:03:40 been through wars you've been through
00:03:42 pandemics you've been through
00:03:43 depressions um
00:03:46 running a company like yours i'm just
00:03:48 dying to know what happens around the
00:03:49 family table when you're talking about
00:03:51 hard times like
00:03:52 what where does that conversation go
00:03:54 like how what do you guys fall back on
00:03:57 uh well you know if my brother eric here
00:03:59 he'd probably say the same thing but uh
00:04:01 we've heard our dad
00:04:02 recount several times how difficult
00:04:05 things were
00:04:06 not that's in his generation but from
00:04:09 his memory as a kid
00:04:10 um being attached to the business all
00:04:12 the way through and the two that really
00:04:14 stick out is world war ii and talked
00:04:16 about rationing
00:04:18 shoes there were only so many shoes and
00:04:20 people lined up for them and all you
00:04:22 have talked about that
00:04:23 and then there was the early 70s when
00:04:26 there was the big
00:04:26 economic depression here where boeing
00:04:29 over the last
00:04:30 hour they laid off a bunch of people
00:04:32 there was an issue you know they weren't
00:04:34 through hard times yeah i mean they were
00:04:35 such the dominant employer here that
00:04:37 they're really
00:04:38 if boeing got sick the whole town got
00:04:40 sick
00:04:41 and you know we were so reliant on the
00:04:43 economy of the city
00:04:45 in those days that my dad talks about
00:04:47 that too so those are the things that
00:04:48 jump to my mind
00:04:50 and uh you know we've got our own
00:04:51 stories to tell now so is he
00:04:53 we've got some like boys is there sort
00:04:55 of like the hand on the shoulder
00:04:56 like like what happens like i mean so
00:04:59 brian and i had a talking
00:05:00 it wasn't a talking to brian was it but
00:05:02 dad came in uh yesterday
00:05:04 and with the talking to you it wasn't a
00:05:06 talking to you i'm like we haven't had
00:05:08 one of those in a while
00:05:09 and it was kind of like he gives us tons
00:05:10 of freedom like what's up with this
00:05:11 community college thing
00:05:12 well it wasn't what's up but it was a
00:05:14 little bit like hey um
00:05:16 love the creative pivots love the work
00:05:18 you're doing for the community
00:05:19 and fundraising also um you can't lose
00:05:22 money forever
00:05:23 and so just want to know if you're gonna
00:05:25 you become a profitable business
00:05:27 um and so dad gives us so much leeway
00:05:32 and i just want to
00:05:33 praise him publicly but at some point
00:05:34 you know that father figure comes in
00:05:37 or your actual father figure comes in at
00:05:38 some point it's your board or it's your
00:05:41 and they and they sort of say hey um how
00:05:44 you doing
00:05:44 can you give us the assurance and and
00:05:46 you start to pull this wisdom from them
00:05:48 does your dad do that is he is there any
00:05:50 sort of like is there any
00:05:52 sort of like what happens there like i
00:05:54 just want to know like hey you guys
00:05:56 are you guys good or is it you know he
00:05:58 um
00:06:00 the thing i really admire about him uh
00:06:02 now i'm a parent myself and i can
00:06:04 appreciate it more
00:06:05 is that he's never really tried to be
00:06:07 our boss
00:06:08 i mean he just wants to be our dad so
00:06:10 what you get is all this
00:06:12 unconditional support and love and we
00:06:14 actually don't
00:06:15 talk about work a lot okay he's
00:06:17 interested in it and we can
00:06:19 but we talk a lot more about husky
00:06:21 basketball or something you know i just
00:06:23 we
00:06:23 he wants to be our dad and i think
00:06:26 what eric and i would say about that is
00:06:29 just what we always feel is this
00:06:31 unconditional
00:06:32 support and that you've got someone
00:06:34 that's really on your side and it's
00:06:36 it's nice when it's also the biggest
00:06:38 shareholder too so that's it that
00:06:40 doesn't hurt
00:06:40 no um but go there for a second is that
00:06:42 so many people watching are involved in
00:06:44 family businesses
00:06:45 or small businesses um is that a secret
00:06:49 to the way that you guys do this in a
00:06:50 certain sense that like
00:06:52 he's a dad first shareholder and former
00:06:55 employee
00:06:56 and you know and former runner of
00:06:59 nordstrom second like
00:07:00 is that a piece of advice that you would
00:07:02 give to anyone
00:07:04 in in those same sort of family business
00:07:06 shoes like
00:07:07 how do you guys do that how do you and
00:07:10 with your own children i'm curious like
00:07:11 what that
00:07:12 that might look like well you know in in
00:07:15 my
00:07:16 generation my time being around we've
00:07:18 always been a public company
00:07:20 so every time someone says something to
00:07:23 me well
00:07:23 it's a family business and your family
00:07:25 owns the business
00:07:26 my first reaction is that's not true my
00:07:29 family has a zillion shareholders that
00:07:31 yeah yeah there are
00:07:32 i mean our family does not own the
00:07:34 majority of
00:07:35 the stock and hasn't for as long as i
00:07:39 can remember
00:07:39 yeah um so the fact is
00:07:43 that there's a real objectivity to how
00:07:44 we run our business and an
00:07:46 accountability
00:07:47 that i think is healthy for our business
00:07:49 it's not about
00:07:51 your dad thinks you're awesome so
00:07:52 therefore you're awesome i mean
00:07:54 we answer to all these shareholders and
00:07:56 investors and what have you
00:07:58 and that keeps you very grounded
00:08:01 and i think keenly aware that you know
00:08:03 you've got a responsibility it goes way
00:08:05 beyond any
00:08:05 sense of entitlement i think just to be
00:08:07 here and hang out and sure
00:08:08 have good times you know it's not i
00:08:10 think we feel the gravity of
00:08:12 the whole size yeah but it but i'd say
00:08:16 in a positive way so to let's just
00:08:18 address like the really hard thing right
00:08:20 now
00:08:20 um restaurants have been uh
00:08:24 uh let's see what's the right word um
00:08:26 our business has been
00:08:27 devastated it's probably like a fair
00:08:29 word to use without
00:08:30 being like using hyperbole retail
00:08:34 also in a very hard situation you're a
00:08:37 publicly traded company
00:08:39 um where do you take your hope from your
00:08:42 inspiration from
00:08:43 your creativity from like how um
00:08:46 what does that look like and feel like
00:08:48 as a leader in the retail industry what
00:08:50 do you hear from your peers like i'm
00:08:51 talking to chefs and other restaurant
00:08:52 owners all the time we're all just sort
00:08:54 of
00:08:54 is that a retail thing do you call up
00:08:56 heads of majors like hey bob
00:08:58 you know jane like how like like you
00:09:01 guys do that or is that like
00:09:02 you know interestingly there really
00:09:05 isn't a lot of camaraderie amongst can
00:09:08 we change
00:09:08 can we invite them in should we is that
00:09:10 a weakness of the system or is that okay
00:09:12 like
00:09:12 i think i actually like the camaraderie
00:09:15 and one of the things that's happened
00:09:17 with covet upon us it has forced more
00:09:19 those conversations than i've ever
00:09:20 really had
00:09:21 really and you know since i've been
00:09:22 around for a long time i've
00:09:24 got a lot of these relationships and
00:09:25 most of it's because i've
00:09:27 sat next to people like a fashion show
00:09:29 or something you know like
00:09:30 okay start talking about stuff and
00:09:33 particularly those first
00:09:34 two months of coven when i'm you know
00:09:36 everyone's just trying to figure what
00:09:37 the heck is going on it was nice to have
00:09:39 some perspective
00:09:40 yeah in some context so yeah i mean i i
00:09:42 talked to the
00:09:43 ceo of sax and i talked to the former
00:09:46 ceo neiman marcus and i talked to the
00:09:48 ceo of bloomingdale's and you know i
00:09:50 i talked to other you know people in our
00:09:52 industry and i found that to be really
00:09:54 helpful
00:09:55 and while we compete what is the
00:09:57 collective word in that sense
00:09:59 obviously these are hard times if you're
00:10:01 in the retail business
00:10:02 but what is sort of the oh
00:10:06 it was pretty tactical in those moments
00:10:08 it was pretty tactical like
00:10:09 are you guys going to close your stores
00:10:11 or are you making people wear masks or
00:10:13 what are you doing about the dressing
00:10:14 room are you or if someone tries on
00:10:17 clothes do you let someone else try it
00:10:18 or do you go
00:10:19 dry clean it right it was all super
00:10:21 tactical right
00:10:22 um but i don't i i guess
00:10:26 i'm a real believer uh that it's good to
00:10:28 be curious and it's good to have those
00:10:30 relationships and we compete with people
00:10:32 but
00:10:33 there's a lot to be gained i think just
00:10:36 by extending yourself
00:10:37 and being curious and talking to people
00:10:39 and listening and and you learn a lot
00:10:41 you ask questions people tell you things
00:10:42 you know so that's helpful
00:10:44 so uh one of our principal motivations
00:10:47 um
00:10:47 looking at the fall season we're coming
00:10:49 out of do we talk about the crab shack
00:10:51 earlier
00:10:51 the smoke rolls in we're like oh my gosh
00:10:53 go it's not going away
00:10:54 smoke won't go away what do we do here
00:10:57 we and we said okay all these kids are
00:10:59 going back to school
00:11:00 your kids my kids the city's kids what
00:11:02 if we
00:11:03 went back to school what if we were able
00:11:05 to
00:11:06 um to publicly be curious and um
00:11:10 what what would it look like if we
00:11:11 focused on this next period
00:11:14 it's not lost to me that last night and
00:11:16 tonight you know we're in this time of
00:11:18 the election and what does it look like
00:11:21 if we stay
00:11:22 curious what does it look like if our
00:11:24 hearts are softened and we have a
00:11:26 mindset
00:11:26 of being learners um is that
00:11:30 at all like i would love to know the
00:11:32 values of it so it can list that's
00:11:34 something that we're focusing on it's a
00:11:35 direction that i want to grow my company
00:11:37 it's a direction that i want to grow
00:11:39 myself
00:11:40 i'm wondering in this period is is
00:11:42 curiosity one of those like what are the
00:11:43 things
00:11:44 at nordstrom that what are those values
00:11:46 and those things that in this time
00:11:48 of heightened pressure and an intensity
00:11:51 and uncertainty and et cetera et cetera
00:11:53 et cetera we've heard that at my time
00:11:54 what do you guys lean back on what do
00:11:56 you fall back on
00:11:59 is that a different way in which ways
00:12:01 are you growing in this period
00:12:02 if curiosity is one of them you know i
00:12:04 think what happens is
00:12:06 it really tests the um the fabric kind
00:12:08 of of your company and
00:12:10 in cultural kinds of ways and
00:12:13 because it's hard for everybody and you
00:12:16 talk about
00:12:17 non-essential businesses which ours is
00:12:20 apparently yours
00:12:21 is fancy clothing you know there's
00:12:23 people in retailing that are doing
00:12:25 fabulously well but there's really not
00:12:27 much that we sell that people
00:12:29 need we sell things people want and so i
00:12:33 you know i don't take offense to it if
00:12:35 someone says we're a non-essential
00:12:36 business you know we're not selling
00:12:37 paper towels
00:12:38 and right and hand sanitizer
00:12:43 um anyway so where was i going with this
00:12:46 uh in terms of like the direction that
00:12:49 you
00:12:50 um that you're growing or that oh yeah
00:12:52 yeah you're taking the company well
00:12:54 yeah so it's the cultural stuff that
00:12:56 really matters and i think if you're
00:12:58 gonna hold people
00:13:00 tight to the mission and make them feel
00:13:03 like they're doing something that's
00:13:04 worthy and worthwhile in a time when the
00:13:06 results don't
00:13:08 having to show for that i think it's got
00:13:10 to be about stuff
00:13:12 all those kind of qualitative things
00:13:14 that make people feel good about
00:13:15 either why they shop with us or why they
00:13:18 work here and so we talk a lot about
00:13:19 those things
00:13:20 and curiosity is is an element of that
00:13:22 but there's also like we had a meeting
00:13:24 yesterday
00:13:25 their leadership group and we talked a
00:13:27 fair amount about things like trust and
00:13:28 grace and things like that and
00:13:30 particularly
00:13:31 in these stressful and difficult times
00:13:33 how we can be there for
00:13:34 each other yeah and you know internal as
00:13:37 a company
00:13:38 first caring for one another right and
00:13:41 you guys are
00:13:42 you're kind of the customer service
00:13:43 kings um
00:13:45 you you sort of put that sort of genre
00:13:47 on the map i don't know when that was
00:13:48 that sort of
00:13:50 you may be blossoming into that my
00:13:52 generation gets no credit for that yeah
00:13:54 i think my dad's generation the ones
00:13:55 that took the idea of customer service
00:13:57 and actually made it a rallying cry
00:14:00 okay and a thing and a differentiator i
00:14:02 think of it as one of the
00:14:04 like very cool things uh seattle has
00:14:06 brought the world coffee and airplanes
00:14:08 and uh
00:14:09 software um and in so many ways i don't
00:14:11 take entire credit for it but in certain
00:14:13 ways
00:14:14 customer service thank you to is it gone
00:14:17 this is whatever wants to know is it
00:14:18 like i get 100 interview questions of
00:14:20 this exact one is it gone
00:14:22 um customer service which i am in the
00:14:24 business of so i have
00:14:25 personal vested interest in this
00:14:26 question high touch
00:14:28 high relationship you know at a table
00:14:31 here you got 20 people all up in your
00:14:33 business standing one table across like
00:14:35 bringing food and forks and knives and
00:14:37 everything like in your guys world
00:14:39 what i love about your store is that
00:14:41 it's a human experience
00:14:42 right and so i'm like wow these people i
00:14:45 i've told this story to you i told
00:14:47 everyone like my last pair of shoes i
00:14:49 was so
00:14:50 uncertain about i tried to get him at
00:14:52 the rack i couldn't find him i didn't
00:14:54 want to pay full price
00:14:55 i'm just gonna be off with you right now
00:14:56 if i called
00:15:01 across the street right past the shoe
00:15:04 shining guys who i
00:15:05 love and i like they're just curious do
00:15:07 you shine your own or do you use those
00:15:09 i use those guys okay oh yeah
00:15:12 and then i go in and i'm like oh my gosh
00:15:14 they're so expensive
00:15:16 i understand also a luxury product and
00:15:18 this woman comes over and i
00:15:20 i just i'm i'm like thank you like i
00:15:22 feel safer
00:15:23 spending this amount of money i've owned
00:15:25 these shoes for eight years now i've
00:15:27 worn them
00:15:27 so many nights on this floor okay your
00:15:30 business
00:15:31 my business is one about relationship
00:15:33 and run about customer service
00:15:36 does it come back is it gone forever
00:15:39 i don't believe either of those extremes
00:15:42 are true but can you take us there like
00:15:43 yeah i
00:15:44 you know i think the big thing about
00:15:45 service is that
00:15:47 how it's defined has changed and and
00:15:49 will continue to change and probably
00:15:50 always has and
00:15:52 i mean the story i have for you about
00:15:53 that is you know for years and years we
00:15:56 had this reputation around
00:15:57 giving great service and anytime there
00:15:59 was some kind of poll taken or survey or
00:16:02 list in a magazine it was like top
00:16:05 customer service nordstrom ritz carlton
00:16:07 hotels
00:16:08 hurts rent-a-cars like yeah it's just
00:16:10 all these you know
00:16:11 like wow that feels great and then and
00:16:14 this is now
00:16:15 gosh maybe it's 20 years ago uh
00:16:18 we're still on these lists but we
00:16:20 noticed we're like
00:16:22 fourth or sixth you know these aren't
00:16:24 things that you
00:16:25 apply for they're just they're
00:16:26 reputational things right
00:16:28 but it's like there's netflix
00:16:32 there's amazon there's
00:16:36 i mean a bunch of the way we butcher
00:16:38 companies that
00:16:39 to our way of defining service had
00:16:42 nothing to do with service they were
00:16:43 more transactional in nature
00:16:44 sure but the mistake well what we
00:16:47 learned through that process
00:16:48 is it's not up to us to define what good
00:16:51 service is it's up to a customer to find
00:16:53 it and increasingly
00:16:54 customers define good service by
00:16:57 convenience
00:16:58 and everything that we did or define
00:17:01 good service around
00:17:02 tended to be a very high touch
00:17:04 experience like you came in
00:17:06 right you know you've got this guy the
00:17:09 sales person
00:17:10 you know and you talk you through all
00:17:11 the stuff and you know
00:17:13 he gave you advice about what to wear it
00:17:15 with and like you came back and saw them
00:17:16 because it didn't fit right and then you
00:17:18 ended up having a relationship right and
00:17:19 then that
00:17:20 worked from there and we still do that
00:17:22 all the time
00:17:24 but we also do well before covet we were
00:17:27 doing about a third of our business
00:17:28 online and now it's over half of our
00:17:29 business online
00:17:31 and so that's a little bit of a
00:17:32 different story i mean you can have some
00:17:34 personalization there for sure
00:17:36 but more of it's about how to take the
00:17:38 friction out of a shopping experience
00:17:40 and so
00:17:40 i think amazon a lot of ways is defined
00:17:42 what good services relative to
00:17:44 convenience they got transparency
00:17:46 it's just they've got speed yeah it's
00:17:48 easy
00:17:49 no friction one click buy you think
00:17:52 about that is it an opportunity
00:17:54 i mean you guys are like that it's a
00:17:55 threat and an opportunity okay
00:17:57 yes are those equal are they like
00:18:00 you know what i'm saying like because
00:18:01 here's the thing i uh
00:18:03 i don't i don't not anytime students see
00:18:05 candles moving into the amazon realm
00:18:07 like i don't have the ability to get
00:18:09 super slick yes we've been packing up
00:18:12 dinners into boxes and sending them to
00:18:14 people's homes so maybe that's a version
00:18:15 of that but
00:18:17 in general it's not a business model
00:18:18 that really works for us we'd like to
00:18:19 get back to doing what we do
00:18:21 um do you just you do both
00:18:24 like what is what is the move there like
00:18:27 we do both i think ultimately we believe
00:18:29 the most successful retailers of the
00:18:31 future are the ones that do both
00:18:32 i think if you only do one at our scale
00:18:35 or the other like if you're just amazon
00:18:38 and as you know
00:18:40 their movement's been we gotta start
00:18:41 having some physical stores and they
00:18:43 look different than the store like ours
00:18:44 but they've got physical stores
00:18:47 um what you see with anyone that's got a
00:18:48 direct-to-customer brand that starts off
00:18:50 as purely an
00:18:51 online thing they ultimately feel the
00:18:53 need to have some physical connection as
00:18:55 well
00:18:56 so what we do is we take our stores
00:18:59 and then we take the online part of it
00:19:00 and all the work that we do is how can
00:19:02 you bring those things together in a
00:19:03 seamless way so customers can access
00:19:05 whatever they want whenever they want
00:19:07 and whatever
00:19:08 that moment suits them i mean you may
00:19:10 have a very high touch thing you need to
00:19:12 go to a store and actually get you know
00:19:15 touch and feel the merchandise and work
00:19:16 with a person and do all this stuff but
00:19:18 you also probably have those times like
00:19:20 i've got to buy a christmas gift from my
00:19:22 mother-in-law
00:19:24 i don't want to spend more than well
00:19:26 maybe you'll spend a lot for your
00:19:27 mother-in-law i don't
00:19:28 i don't want to spend more than 75 bucks
00:19:30 and i just need to get this thing online
00:19:32 i'm not watching it's like 375. i'm just
00:19:34 saying this is yours
00:19:37 like no limit but yes but those those
00:19:40 everyone has those times and it doesn't
00:19:42 mean you're one or the other
00:19:43 you're both and our job is to pivot
00:19:46 seamlessly and allow it all to work
00:19:48 together kind of
00:19:49 because we have this foundation that
00:19:50 allows it to happen without everyone
00:19:53 so i feel the same way fine dining is a
00:19:54 little bit the same way which is
00:19:56 everyone's like well what is great fine
00:19:57 dying i'm like um
00:19:59 you tell me like literally if i write
00:20:02 that script
00:20:03 i'm it's a little self-serving but if i
00:20:05 am attuned to
00:20:08 this person's running in to grab a quick
00:20:09 gift from other law wants
00:20:12 straight up the quickest easiest
00:20:14 transaction as possible
00:20:15 this person is shopping with her
00:20:17 girlfriend they're just out to have a
00:20:19 coffee and be
00:20:20 relational and like like those are two
00:20:23 so different and we get the same thing
00:20:25 in the restaurant which is like
00:20:26 this person wants to engage with the
00:20:28 staff and be a part of a restaurant
00:20:30 and this couple over here they just need
00:20:32 some space and time themselves right so
00:20:33 i think of
00:20:34 i think of this as like if we're not
00:20:36 listening to the guest
00:20:37 at the door or on the phone before they
00:20:39 get to the door
00:20:40 who are we really serving we're serving
00:20:43 ourselves unless we're completely
00:20:44 attenuated
00:20:46 kind of um to who they are okay so brian
00:20:48 just sent me a notice like we got so
00:20:49 many questions but before we get to so
00:20:50 many questions
00:20:51 i have a couple of quick ones you know
00:20:52 what i got to tell you really quickly
00:20:53 you guys do
00:20:55 a remarkable job with service you really
00:20:57 do and i think in so many ways you set
00:20:58 the gold standard and
00:21:00 one of the ways that i think that's
00:21:01 reflected you know this
00:21:03 when we have people that were they're in
00:21:06 town whether they're vendors
00:21:08 or you know if we have a kind of work
00:21:10 thing that we're doing that's
00:21:11 celebrating people
00:21:12 or whoever it is guess we
00:21:15 most often come here because i think
00:21:17 it's so
00:21:18 it's so reflective to your point about
00:21:21 seattle and this kind of service culture
00:21:23 and it it it
00:21:24 feels great to be a part of this
00:21:27 experience
00:21:28 because you guys are so in tune to your
00:21:29 point about once someone's coming the
00:21:31 door you're you're on it i mean i
00:21:33 guess i'm going to go there because my
00:21:35 head is a little bit wrapped up in
00:21:37 in the in the emotions of of an election
00:21:39 and probably a lot of people are
00:21:41 here's i just i'll just be like on the
00:21:42 rose and say it um
00:21:44 our hope at the restaurant
00:21:47 is that we would stay turned toward the
00:21:50 stranger
00:21:51 is literally how i think of this turn
00:21:54 toward the other
00:21:55 the person that is different from us the
00:21:57 person
00:21:58 who looks and acts and believes and
00:22:01 votes
00:22:02 differently than us and i feel like that
00:22:06 is hospitality
00:22:07 and i think what i'm loving about
00:22:11 sitting with you tonight in a w when
00:22:13 would this ever happen
00:22:14 um i wouldn't wish coveted on anyone but
00:22:16 i wouldn't want to take
00:22:17 away an opportunity to talk about sort
00:22:19 of the the real issues at hand and to me
00:22:22 regardless i don't know who you voted
00:22:24 for regardless of who the people voted
00:22:26 for regardless of who is a president i
00:22:28 wonder if as a country
00:22:30 we can remember that
00:22:33 that isn't the thing the thing is how do
00:22:35 we remember that you're human and i'm
00:22:37 human
00:22:38 how do we remember that we're in the
00:22:39 same boat together
00:22:41 how do you remember how alike we are in
00:22:44 spite of the fact that we probably have
00:22:45 differences and i
00:22:47 and i uh that to me is is a is a message
00:22:50 for for my own heart it's a message
00:22:52 inside of our home with our children
00:22:55 it's the message in our company it's the
00:22:57 way that we try to serve
00:22:58 it's it's why it feels different maybe
00:23:00 in this restaurant is i honestly believe
00:23:02 it's my job to make space
00:23:04 for someone who's different than me and
00:23:07 i don't just mean
00:23:08 carve out a table give them a seat and
00:23:10 charge them for dinner
00:23:11 i mean like honestly consider maybe i
00:23:14 have something to learn
00:23:15 from them and i i believe that to be
00:23:17 part of the magic of your guy's service
00:23:19 i believe it to be in the dna
00:23:20 of this city as a as a city that is open
00:23:23 to thinking that way and
00:23:25 okay hold on a second i'm distracted
00:23:28 brian i'm getting there
00:23:29 two quick questions i just this is like
00:23:31 personal i gotta get perfect this was
00:23:33 really good i'm
00:23:33 enjoying it holes in your socks i just
00:23:36 have to ask this
00:23:37 win and and and brandi's here like when
00:23:40 i'm just curious
00:23:41 like everyone thinks like a king and we
00:23:43 have like macaroni and cheese and hot
00:23:44 dogs at home i'm sure they think
00:23:46 the the do you have holes in your socks
00:23:49 like it right
00:23:50 now we go through how often not these
00:23:52 socks
00:23:53 no but just how often at home is it a
00:23:55 thing
00:23:56 like do you struggle from what the rest
00:23:58 of us sort of
00:23:59 how often do you get you just like well
00:24:02 i mean you know right now i go through
00:24:03 your sock drawer how many socks have
00:24:05 holes in it
00:24:05 be honest not that many but you know my
00:24:08 family well enough and i think you know
00:24:10 my dad
00:24:11 who's got such kind of a ground and
00:24:13 practical approach so things
00:24:15 you know i could always have new clothes
00:24:16 and stuff but a big part of what's on my
00:24:18 mind is
00:24:19 have i gotten the wear out of this that
00:24:21 i need yeah if i've gotten the use out
00:24:23 of this you feel like okay like more
00:24:24 things see i feel like i
00:24:25 should wear it i do i tend to do that
00:24:28 okay yes
00:24:29 a piece of clothing okay
00:24:32 that you currently wear in public and
00:24:34 probably should have let go of years ago
00:24:36 i i know there's one
00:24:37 there come on like i just have a
00:24:39 question for my wife is there something
00:24:41 my self-awareness i'm sure there's one
00:24:43 you own a clothing
00:24:44 of not owned but you run a clothing
00:24:46 company just is this a high school
00:24:48 t-shirt like what is it like is it is it
00:24:50 a pair of pants it's not trimmed
00:24:51 properly
00:24:52 well no i'm i'm so old that the high
00:24:55 schooler calls t-shirts out the door i
00:24:57 mean that
00:24:57 okay okay well i'm old enough that that
00:25:01 would be a
00:25:02 that would be a stretch um of course i
00:25:04 had like 20 at home and i mean
00:25:05 top of my head i cannot think of
00:25:07 something all right
00:25:09 um but i definitely have this practical
00:25:12 sense about
00:25:14 value and use and you know like
00:25:17 it's it's like anything i'm not a
00:25:19 collector of things yeah like
00:25:21 i think we've talked about this even
00:25:22 like relative wine or something i like
00:25:24 wine and i've have i have wine in my
00:25:26 house
00:25:26 but i'm not a collector i want to i want
00:25:29 to i want to
00:25:30 drink it i mean i want enough that i
00:25:31 have choices and all that stuff
00:25:33 but i i don't want to have thousands of
00:25:36 bottles where i just
00:25:37 it's like a trophy that's why i can't be
00:25:40 open and the guy who makes the wine at
00:25:43 this
00:25:43 domain of the roman conte right so
00:25:45 famous winemaker said uh to our family
00:25:47 in his basement he said uh
00:25:49 just never forget this one thing for me
00:25:52 wine has
00:25:53 no value in the bottle it only gains its
00:25:56 value when it's opened and shared among
00:25:57 friends
00:25:58 this guy could sell his wine for
00:25:59 anything he wanted right yeah our
00:26:00 bottles on our list for like thousands
00:26:01 of dollars
00:26:02 and he's literally reminding us he's
00:26:04 like it
00:26:05 literally was made to be opened and
00:26:08 enjoyed with other people
00:26:10 you if you stash it if you hoard it
00:26:12 you're robbing it
00:26:14 of its intrinsic value take me there so
00:26:16 that's a real quick i got a
00:26:17 neighbor we had uh drinks with them
00:26:19 recently and he was serving really nice
00:26:20 wine just like
00:26:21 here you want glass of wine like geez
00:26:22 cheese yeah like no way wow
00:26:25 and he says you know he goes i've lived
00:26:27 long enough and i like wine i've done
00:26:29 well he goes but there's three kinds of
00:26:30 wine there's the everyday drinker
00:26:32 there's kind of the weekend wine and
00:26:33 there's the anniversary wine
00:26:35 he goes i've just kind of moved to the
00:26:37 place where why wouldn't i just drink
00:26:38 the anniversary wine
00:26:40 all the time every day no regrets i go
00:26:42 good on you that's that's awesome
00:26:44 if you're gonna make a mistake open it
00:26:46 early and drink it now that's that's
00:26:47 right now we're online but
00:26:48 okay what are you getting on the chat
00:26:50 like what's going on i was wondering if
00:26:51 mr nordstrom
00:26:53 could talk about the employee handbook
00:26:55 how they got
00:26:57 to the one line use good judgment in all
00:27:00 situations
00:27:01 use good judgment in all situations yeah
00:27:04 this isn't your important is that an
00:27:05 important line in the book
00:27:06 no that's that was the book and we
00:27:08 didn't actually literally for years and
00:27:10 years and years that was the deal now it
00:27:12 wasn't that we didn't have
00:27:14 procedural things people had to know
00:27:15 like here's how you punch out here they
00:27:17 bring up
00:27:18 something on the register and here's you
00:27:20 know what are your benefits but i show
00:27:21 up on day one you that's the advantage
00:27:22 that's what we gave to people is
00:27:24 use good judgment in all situations and
00:27:26 i i think we still talk about it but
00:27:28 it's not a literal book anymore but
00:27:29 that's
00:27:31 it's i'm really glad you brought that up
00:27:33 because it's i think it's it's a
00:27:35 it's a poignant reminder of kind of the
00:27:37 essence of
00:27:39 why we do we do it in again the clarity
00:27:42 of purpose
00:27:42 yeah right i mean if you gave someone as
00:27:45 first of all as you well know
00:27:48 they're every night you're open for
00:27:49 business something's going to come up
00:27:51 that doesn't quite fit a book every
00:27:54 night
00:27:54 let's just call it everything's going to
00:27:56 come up yes you're like
00:27:57 i got to use some judgment here you know
00:27:59 because this is not well no it's
00:28:00 here's what i love about it okay just
00:28:02 say it's human so people all the time is
00:28:04 like well how do you train good service
00:28:06 i'm like oh my gosh you got to be alive
00:28:08 and present yes right brene brown's like
00:28:10 present over perfect like
00:28:12 like present to say like there is no
00:28:15 script for
00:28:16 this but i i see the person in front of
00:28:18 me i'm reacting to it
00:28:20 i'm a human like
00:28:23 and here's my and here's my my
00:28:25 person-to-person thing and i think
00:28:27 um what i love about that axiom or ruler
00:28:30 i don't know what you call it but it
00:28:32 allows your
00:28:32 employees to be human and to not be
00:28:36 following the company script which is
00:28:38 the only thing we had to kill us when we
00:28:40 go into a store
00:28:41 the only thing we had to do over time to
00:28:42 amend that was i think it used to say
00:28:44 use your good judgment
00:28:46 sometimes people's judgment or the way
00:28:49 they rationalize the decision
00:28:50 is not good judgment so we you're out so
00:28:53 you're it use good judgment
00:28:55 commonly understood to be good judges
00:28:57 well it gives us some latitude to
00:28:58 address the situation okay
00:28:59 yeah because otherwise you guys kids
00:29:01 like look this is my good judgment yeah
00:29:02 like no man
00:29:03 i decided to just comp their dinner
00:29:04 because i know that thank you for
00:29:07 bringing that up because
00:29:08 there's a few servers that was my good
00:29:09 judgment okay next question this one
00:29:11 from
00:29:12 the great food writer and food critic
00:29:14 nancy lison
00:29:16 has asked uh how can you afford
00:29:19 to take back so many no questions asked
00:29:22 returns
00:29:23 yeah no how does that happen like come
00:29:24 on that is the business strategy
00:29:26 killing you guys um did you ever return
00:29:29 a tire
00:29:30 like there's so much you did that so
00:29:31 that's true and so can you just take us
00:29:33 there like you want me to tell the
00:29:34 entire story yeah i'll tell you about
00:29:36 this yes
00:29:36 yeah uh well in the 70s
00:29:40 uh this is my dad's generation was
00:29:41 involved they bought
00:29:43 some stores in alaska called the great
00:29:46 commercial company
00:29:47 and they had a store in kenai and one in
00:29:50 fairbanks
00:29:50 these are the ones they were retail
00:29:52 stores but they were general
00:29:54 merchandisers they sold
00:29:55 sleeping bags and shoes
00:29:58 and you know gas tanks and yeah
00:30:01 tires so um naturally
00:30:05 so we had bought these stores and this
00:30:06 is a time when the whole
00:30:08 oil boom was happening up there and
00:30:10 there was this real big influx of money
00:30:12 and people
00:30:13 a lot of activity in alaska and at that
00:30:15 time we weren't a national company we
00:30:16 were northwest companies so we had to go
00:30:19 the rationalization was let's go places
00:30:21 where people know who we are okay let's
00:30:22 not go open a store in
00:30:24 missouri sure i mean i think in alaska
00:30:26 or staying in oregon
00:30:27 or yeah okay so what happens was that
00:30:30 the northern commercial company
00:30:32 sold tires and so some guy comes in
00:30:35 there i don't know a month or two
00:30:36 after we owned these stores and had
00:30:38 taken it over and then had our stuff in
00:30:40 there
00:30:41 and this was in fairbanks and uh he goes
00:30:44 i don't know what's going on in here now
00:30:46 but i bought these tires here and
00:30:47 they're not working out for me
00:30:49 and um the guy said
00:30:52 okay how much did you pay for them these
00:30:54 tires were you know 75 dollars whatever
00:30:56 it goes
00:30:56 okay so we just just did it
00:31:00 um it just made sense well it it makes
00:31:02 sense in that context now like
00:31:04 if someone came to me today and said i
00:31:05 want you to return these tires
00:31:08 you know you're being taken like that
00:31:10 yeah but i mean the guys just kind of
00:31:11 like i don't know
00:31:12 and even then it was pretty remarkable
00:31:15 the interesting story is
00:31:16 that guy is is i think if not
00:31:20 current no if not so current employee
00:31:22 like a very recently former player of
00:31:24 alaska airlines
00:31:25 no way yeah and i found that out because
00:31:28 you know our uh one of our board members
00:31:30 the ceo of alaska and we talked about
00:31:32 this because yeah i mean the guy
00:31:33 that did that he's kind of he's kind of
00:31:35 like legends this year i feel like i
00:31:37 want him to be t-shirts
00:31:38 i don't even know his name but the guy i
00:31:40 feel like he's he's like the
00:31:42 the the the forefather of great service
00:31:45 everyone tells the story but you think
00:31:46 about that
00:31:48 whatever that costs us let's say that
00:31:49 cost us a hundred bucks i don't know
00:31:50 yeah
00:31:51 how much value do you think we got out
00:31:53 of that over there they talk about that
00:31:54 at harvard business school
00:31:56 yeah you're asking me this now yeah most
00:31:58 every interview i've ever
00:32:00 had at any kind of scale i've had people
00:32:02 at the tables but nordstrom returns
00:32:04 tires i'm like okay
00:32:05 cool i get it like i've heard it and
00:32:07 that whole kind of spirit of
00:32:09 intent i think opens the door for people
00:32:12 to think more broadly
00:32:14 about something like a return policy so
00:32:15 the question is
00:32:17 how do we afford to do it it's because
00:32:19 we do
00:32:20 more sales volume than others these
00:32:23 practices that we have
00:32:25 enables us to do more volume okay we do
00:32:28 a lot of business
00:32:28 because we have customer friendly
00:32:31 policies
00:32:31 we we do a better job with wallet share
00:32:34 with that customer you know loyalty and
00:32:35 what have you
00:32:36 that's always been the premise and then
00:32:38 the other part is
00:32:40 there's no amount of money you could
00:32:41 apply to marketing
00:32:43 stuff like that and you would no one
00:32:45 would ever believe it because it's
00:32:46 revealing the character of your company
00:32:50 it lives because it's true it lives
00:32:52 because we haven't talked about it liz
00:32:54 because people talk about this yeah and
00:32:56 so the value that we get
00:32:58 reputationally about what is nordstrom
00:32:59 and almost always the first thing out of
00:33:01 people's mouth it's
00:33:02 either shoes or it's it's about service
00:33:04 yeah we couldn't have
00:33:06 bought that branding
00:33:09 have to actually earn that over time so
00:33:11 whatever it costs us to return a pair of
00:33:13 tires have you seen
00:33:14 it totally worth it i mean if you sent
00:33:15 him a pair of tires i feel like they're
00:33:17 a thank you gift like it feels like
00:33:18 every cruiser would die
00:33:20 or on his tree or something i don't know
00:33:22 we still have st we still have stores
00:33:23 where you walk in the employee entrance
00:33:25 there's a tire hanging up there
00:33:27 on the walls is what's your tire story
00:33:29 so we still try to con
00:33:30 you know encourage people to think about
00:33:33 you like
00:33:33 one of the things we talk about and this
00:33:35 happens a store all the time you could
00:33:37 see it
00:33:38 is when people come in with like an old
00:33:39 ratty bag
00:33:41 and they can walk in you can see the
00:33:42 sales people kind of like comes yeah
00:33:44 watch out for this person and so what
00:33:45 we've talked about is
00:33:46 embrace the brown box or embrace the bag
00:33:49 and you'll see it like we open a brand
00:33:51 new store oftentimes the first person
00:33:52 walking someone's got
00:33:54 like a ratty old bag and a five-year-old
00:33:56 pair of shoes
00:33:57 and it's like when they learn to kind of
00:34:00 embrace that because it makes a like a
00:34:03 fabled thing yeah
00:34:04 it totally makes that worth it it
00:34:07 releases it frees up
00:34:08 we get these gifts from sometimes that
00:34:10 you know you're probably aware but
00:34:12 washington state had this kind of funny
00:34:13 gift cigarette law and they used to take
00:34:14 them back
00:34:15 if people didn't redeem them and we had
00:34:16 to pay the state and so anyway you get
00:34:18 these gifts like 20
00:34:20 30 40 years old right yeah and you know
00:34:23 how old they are because like dinner for
00:34:24 two candles you know like
00:34:26 forty five dollars we're like whoa it's
00:34:27 an old one because it hasn't cost that
00:34:29 for a while
00:34:30 and it's always like what do we do with
00:34:31 this it's clearly null and void but it's
00:34:33 like
00:34:34 this person has held on to this or addie
00:34:37 piece of paper
00:34:38 for 30 years you bet we're going to
00:34:41 honor that
00:34:42 please don't bring all your old gifts
00:34:43 first but like it's like you said i'm
00:34:45 thinking
00:34:45 someone's going to roll in some tires
00:34:47 while i've heard pete talk about the
00:34:49 feeling of like man you've been waiting
00:34:51 that long
00:34:52 wow how can we how can we not honor that
00:34:54 and so i don't know i i feel like any
00:34:56 time
00:34:57 you get to let your your company
00:35:00 even as leaders the anytime we get to be
00:35:02 seen
00:35:03 actually seen for who we are and we're
00:35:05 not perfect right there's so much
00:35:08 wrong with us but then it's like when
00:35:10 your staff are like cool i knew you
00:35:11 weren't perfect and now you're willing
00:35:13 to admit it
00:35:14 and i think if the restaurant can do
00:35:15 that it's like we're not perfect
00:35:17 um so if you can see us for our
00:35:18 imperfections then somehow we become
00:35:21 uh somehow the relationship starts to
00:35:24 work and evolve hospital evolve service
00:35:26 if all hospitality if the thing that
00:35:27 we're doing is relationship well then
00:35:29 that's
00:35:30 but don't you think about when you kind
00:35:32 of talk about the humanity part of it i
00:35:33 mean isn't
00:35:34 what that out all is about is spirit of
00:35:36 intent i mean no one's
00:35:38 really going to do things perfectly but
00:35:39 i think if you feel if people feel like
00:35:41 you're authentically doing the best you
00:35:43 can
00:35:44 they're accepting of some mistakes as
00:35:46 long as you're accountable for it
00:35:48 and you're and you're doing your best
00:35:50 yes and you know we say we're sorry
00:35:53 a lot because we mess up plenty but most
00:35:56 people accept that apology and you know
00:35:58 like thanks
00:35:59 and then you know we try to find a way
00:36:00 to move on from do you you you did the
00:36:02 whole this is
00:36:03 the tradition your family you start from
00:36:05 the bottom and work your way we do we
00:36:06 we're dishwashers
00:36:08 you guys start selling shoes that kind
00:36:09 of in the stock room yeah and i'm just
00:36:11 going to say like i'm just
00:36:13 i kind of think that you get the better
00:36:14 daily like the soccer room sounds like
00:36:16 more fun than the dishwashers it's
00:36:17 steamy it's hot back there you got your
00:36:19 hands and other people's salads and
00:36:20 stuff but whatever we don't have to
00:36:21 compare it's cool
00:36:22 but anyway so you start do you have a
00:36:24 story do you remember growing up
00:36:26 do you and being in a situation where
00:36:28 your
00:36:29 metal a little bit was tested either
00:36:31 your patients either like
00:36:32 like yeah maybe a stockroom story so i'm
00:36:37 14 13. i'm young
00:36:40 and i'm working the shoe stock room and
00:36:43 the
00:36:43 the buyer manager person said hey you
00:36:45 know one of our vendors downstairs
00:36:47 with his cases and bring them up you
00:36:49 know because in those days they would
00:36:50 come travel to us and show us their case
00:36:51 of shoes and we
00:36:53 big old and can you go down the freight
00:36:55 elevator and um
00:36:57 help them bring it up i'm like okay well
00:37:00 the guy the vendor had no idea
00:37:02 who i was i and clearly i was it's kind
00:37:05 of cool
00:37:05 young well yeah i was young and probably
00:37:08 not keep and he was
00:37:09 ticked because i i may have taken a
00:37:11 wrong turn or pressed the wrong
00:37:13 button and so the guy's like mad at me
00:37:17 you know and it was upsetting
00:37:21 um but i mean i remember the experience
00:37:24 and i came and i
00:37:25 told uh he may have actually even let it
00:37:28 show in front of the manager that
00:37:31 and i the manager let the guy have it i
00:37:34 think he pretty much threw him out
00:37:36 because he was oh the guy was openly
00:37:38 really rude to me yeah
00:37:40 and you know i was i was a kid and that
00:37:43 um that meant a lot to me because it
00:37:45 showed
00:37:46 that uh we weren't going to be tolerant
00:37:48 of bad behavior we're not going to
00:37:50 rationalize that
00:37:51 and someone on this team had my back and
00:37:53 not because my name was pete nordstrom
00:37:55 although i'm sure that didn't right it
00:37:57 didn't hurt but you don't but you don't
00:37:58 do that
00:37:59 we talk with your customers all the time
00:38:01 how far do you take customer service
00:38:03 i get asked that all the time and i feel
00:38:06 like
00:38:07 um when when the guest or the customer
00:38:11 or the client whoever it is
00:38:12 is still relationally forward i'll be
00:38:15 there
00:38:16 i i won't when you say relationally i
00:38:18 mean like
00:38:19 so you got a complaint or say you got
00:38:21 this guy like
00:38:22 i feel like if they're still interested
00:38:24 in relationship if they really
00:38:26 want dinner to go well it it was one
00:38:29 thing to stand up and complain and make
00:38:30 a scene in the restaurant and throw your
00:38:31 wine
00:38:32 all of this has happened right it's
00:38:34 another thing to just want to make a
00:38:36 scene
00:38:36 just to to hurt the restaurant or walk
00:38:38 out it's an it's that's one thing but
00:38:40 it's one thing to kind of just say
00:38:42 my feelings are hurt this isn't working
00:38:44 for me right and so any time that the
00:38:46 the the the customer is still
00:38:49 like candles can you i'm i'm in
00:38:53 are you in then then i'm in like i'll go
00:38:56 all the way there and sometimes the
00:38:57 staff's like holy cow and
00:38:59 but the minute that that it is abusive
00:39:02 or the minute that
00:39:04 really the person is just aiming to hurt
00:39:06 just aiming to be mean
00:39:08 i don't know where do you draw the line
00:39:10 on how far do you go
00:39:13 a company famous for customer service
00:39:15 how far do you go like how do you draw
00:39:16 that line
00:39:17 well we wouldn't tolerate anyone being
00:39:20 disrespectful i mean in an inflammatory
00:39:23 way to any of our people
00:39:24 i'm not that that's game over yeah we're
00:39:27 done
00:39:27 i also we also wouldn't like this
00:39:30 happens quite often someone will say
00:39:33 i want you to compensate me for my
00:39:36 bad experience or the time that this has
00:39:38 taken for me to get this situation
00:39:40 created
00:39:41 and we don't do that yeah we don't you
00:39:43 know a lot of people give gift cards
00:39:44 they throw gift cards at a way of trying
00:39:46 to appease people it's our thing is
00:39:48 well our thing is like i don't know how
00:39:49 to put the correct value
00:39:52 so if i say to you okay here's a 50 gift
00:39:54 card you may say i am completely
00:39:55 insulted that you think my time is only
00:39:57 worth 50
00:39:58 so i i said what we've just learned over
00:40:00 the years is that such a slippery slope
00:40:02 what we have to do is just be able to
00:40:04 apologize but
00:40:05 then you'll get some people that'll say
00:40:07 well i'm never going to shop with you
00:40:09 again and i've cut my credit card
00:40:11 and i want you to give me a gift card
00:40:13 and to your place
00:40:14 why would we give you a gift card if
00:40:16 you're telling us you will never shop
00:40:17 with us again
00:40:19 the answer is no yeah and you know
00:40:22 i think that's really hard for people to
00:40:24 understand er i mean eric and i get this
00:40:27 all the time but stuff i guess i would i
00:40:30 would classify that as
00:40:31 like blatant opportunism it really isn't
00:40:34 about
00:40:34 you can see someone trying to repair of
00:40:37 situations
00:40:38 i'm talking about like there really
00:40:39 isn't the relationship it fully is it's
00:40:41 like i'm seeing if i can get 45 bucks
00:40:43 out of this guy
00:40:44 yeah and you know that's what i want to
00:40:46 do and like yeah we're not doing that
00:40:48 so look i don't know if that's the
00:40:50 perfect way to go it's just in our
00:40:51 experience
00:40:54 that's that that i think is is the right
00:40:56 way to go
00:40:57 i have a question about working with
00:40:58 eric but but go ahead brian i know you
00:40:59 have one too
00:41:00 you have a question about working with
00:41:01 his brother and how wonderful it is yeah
00:41:03 it couldn't be better let me see is the
00:41:06 camera stopped rolling you and i could
00:41:08 just talk about working with your
00:41:08 brother
00:41:10 on the chat tonight just just there's so
00:41:13 much love
00:41:14 for nordstrom of course and the
00:41:16 community people are calling out
00:41:17 the managers they've worked for stories
00:41:21 and so just so 119 years of awesomeness
00:41:24 you guys
00:41:25 in our own time
00:41:29 good questions i have a bunch of rapid
00:41:31 fire questions maybe yeah let's go okay
00:41:33 uh but a good
00:41:34 a bigger question and it's for both of
00:41:35 you but don't go too
00:41:37 long on it because you can go for a
00:41:39 while i'm sorry i tried to keep
00:41:40 short i don't know customer service is
00:41:43 is one thing face to face
00:41:44 but as the world is becoming more
00:41:47 digital as social media
00:41:48 and your online store is becoming most
00:41:51 or half your business you said
00:41:53 how does customer service this
00:41:55 interaction translate into social media
00:41:57 how do you translate it onto twitter and
00:41:59 instagram
00:42:00 how do you have those types of
00:42:03 uh interactions when it's not face to
00:42:07 face anymore but it's digital
00:42:08 how do you separate yourself well i
00:42:11 think you could still do it in a
00:42:13 personal way
00:42:13 because those those relationships
00:42:16 usually work back to being attached to
00:42:17 person like there's
00:42:18 there's a story of one of our guys um
00:42:21 one of our people who works in
00:42:23 pittsburgh
00:42:24 when covid came and we had a downsize we
00:42:26 had to lay people off and yeah
00:42:28 and this guy was a manager and we're
00:42:30 like we're gonna have a manager job for
00:42:31 anymore but we'd like to stay on the
00:42:33 team and
00:42:33 and he talks about like you can say i
00:42:35 got a family home i gotta figure out how
00:42:36 to do this
00:42:37 you know there's no one coming the store
00:42:39 i gotta figure out how to make a living
00:42:40 and he goes i'm gonna
00:42:41 i'm gonna do it all like through
00:42:43 instagram i'm going to
00:42:45 kind of put it out there because i got a
00:42:46 pretty good following i'm going to do
00:42:47 this like himself
00:42:48 he's i'm not going to tell you the
00:42:50 number but he sold
00:42:52 like literally hundreds of thousands of
00:42:54 shoes like in three months
00:42:55 just because he figured out how to tap
00:42:58 into
00:42:58 it's serving people that he knew and
00:43:00 just saying hey
00:43:01 and he said my three best customers i
00:43:04 think it was i've never met
00:43:06 no way and he's in pittsburgh yeah so he
00:43:08 goes i got customers in l.a and new york
00:43:10 city goes but i post all these shoes we
00:43:12 have a really good offer there a lot of
00:43:13 designer
00:43:15 goods and sweet is he available by the
00:43:17 way yeah if you go to norfolk
00:43:18 i think an instagram i think it's
00:43:19 nordstrom men's
00:43:22 is it nordstrom men's designer or men's
00:43:24 designer okay did you
00:43:25 find him anyway he eats there we put in
00:43:28 the class notes we take class notes and
00:43:29 we send it to people afterwards so get
00:43:31 it to the afterwards
00:43:32 i'll get yeah because i got it yeah
00:43:33 anyway this guy has figured out how to
00:43:35 do it so i think
00:43:36 the point is he has figured out how to
00:43:39 create
00:43:40 personalization high touch good service
00:43:43 in a different medium
00:43:44 and it's i mean that requires creativity
00:43:47 as you talk for and it's super inspiring
00:43:49 it's like
00:43:49 wow he's not a guy you know like you
00:43:52 think about there's always the example
00:43:53 is a car
00:43:54 lot a bunch of guys standing there
00:43:55 waiting for someone to come on the car
00:43:57 lot then they're all over them yeah
00:43:58 our thing is like you got to create your
00:44:00 own business you can't just stand here
00:44:02 and wait for a bunch of traffic to come
00:44:04 because it might not come and we've we
00:44:06 have a lot of people over the years that
00:44:07 were really successful because they're
00:44:08 hustlers
00:44:09 it was busy place if you hustled you did
00:44:11 well and those days
00:44:13 at least now are kind of over if you
00:44:15 can't find a way
00:44:16 to create your own business we'll give
00:44:18 you the platform
00:44:19 the inventory all the all that stuff
00:44:22 yeah to have your own business
00:44:24 yeah those people do well brian and i
00:44:27 um got challenged years ago 10 15 years
00:44:30 ago it said
00:44:31 canvas is relevant you guys don't do
00:44:32 social media and we were wrestling with
00:44:34 social media because we were like gosh
00:44:35 it doesn't
00:44:36 feel like us as a brand it's sort of
00:44:39 like
00:44:39 it's like kind of like shouting in a
00:44:41 relationship so anyway we had to wrestle
00:44:43 this and we came to the idea that any
00:44:45 time
00:44:45 we put something out there we want it to
00:44:47 give
00:44:48 more than it takes like literally that's
00:44:51 kind of
00:44:52 i don't know if we're winning by the way
00:44:53 but like that's kind of the mantra
00:44:55 is if we're gonna post something on
00:44:56 instagram does it
00:44:58 is it asking if if i if if if social or
00:45:01 if anything out there
00:45:02 is a relationship between us and them
00:45:06 um am i in generally am i
00:45:09 am i taking in this relationship more
00:45:11 than giving or am i giving and it sounds
00:45:13 like
00:45:14 this guy is literally seeding value out
00:45:17 there
00:45:18 like creating value giving and and of
00:45:20 course it catches fire because any
00:45:22 relationship that takes more than it
00:45:23 gives is one that you don't want to be
00:45:25 in and
00:45:26 and we all spend time with those people
00:45:27 who are so other centered and so
00:45:30 you know what i'm saying i think of i
00:45:32 don't know maybe that's
00:45:33 maybe that's why it's successful well
00:45:34 again i think that's really more an
00:45:36 issue of creativity and just
00:45:39 business in these times and you guys
00:45:40 have demonstrated this maybe as well as
00:45:42 anybody
00:45:43 requires some scrappiness i mean there's
00:45:45 not necessarily a playbook for all this
00:45:46 stuff
00:45:47 you better have some agility and some
00:45:49 creativity
00:45:50 and some scrappiness or it's going to be
00:45:52 hard yeah it's street ball
00:45:54 yeah yeah it's not all right what else
00:45:57 did we got like five minutes before we
00:45:58 got five minutes okay here we go ready
00:46:01 grab fire let's do it let's do it
00:46:05 can i just do yes and no answers is that
00:46:07 what you're saying maybe
00:46:08 a lot of people their grandparents or
00:46:10 friends called it uncle nordies
00:46:12 growing up do you know where that came
00:46:14 from no and actually i've never
00:46:16 more than one person is like oh yeah i
00:46:17 don't know about the uncle nordy you
00:46:19 don't have an uncle what did you call
00:46:20 nordy
00:46:21 no there was never a stuffed or
00:46:24 something
00:46:25 there was never like a bear at christmas
00:46:26 that was uncle nordy i don't know about
00:46:28 the crease
00:46:29 can we create the uncle nordy tradition
00:46:31 right now i think we can just write this
00:46:32 into the script maybe okay maybe later
00:46:35 recently noticed that all of your brands
00:46:36 have banned fur
00:46:38 do you think others are going to follow
00:46:40 suit how is the industry or the customer
00:46:43 responded to your stance on fur
00:46:46 well um yeah we're we've made the
00:46:49 declaration that i think as of
00:46:52 fall of 21 i think it is it's maybe a
00:46:54 year from now or
00:46:56 less that we won't have any fur
00:46:59 that we sell or exotic skins um we
00:47:02 weren't the first to do that
00:47:04 so i'm not sure we deserve a ton of
00:47:05 credit for breaking a lot of ground i
00:47:07 mean
00:47:07 part of it is just following the
00:47:09 zeitgeist of what's going on with
00:47:10 customers and
00:47:12 trying to be relevant and that's humble
00:47:14 of you also there's a bunch of people
00:47:16 out there who see
00:47:17 a one path and choose not to go there
00:47:19 and well but it's
00:47:20 pretty cool it's actually a really
00:47:22 liberating thing about what we do is we
00:47:24 follow
00:47:25 kind of the customer sentiment um and
00:47:28 you can really see where things are
00:47:29 going we've there's
00:47:30 there's been a strong anti-fur movement
00:47:32 for a long time
00:47:33 but we're always like looking we got
00:47:34 customers that want to buy this from us
00:47:36 and expect to
00:47:37 buy it from us and maybe they don't buy
00:47:38 live in seattle but in chicago they buy
00:47:40 a lot
00:47:40 and they all come here and we've got
00:47:42 this decentralized kind of way of doing
00:47:44 things we want to serve
00:47:45 customers chicago for their need of
00:47:46 chicago or whatever the example might be
00:47:48 but over time that whole idea
00:47:52 and it's almost part of like the
00:47:54 sustainability idea which is
00:47:55 it's gone way more than just kind of an
00:47:58 interesting
00:47:59 special interest group it is a it's a
00:48:01 theme that cuts across
00:48:04 a lot of customers and it actually
00:48:06 influences buying decisions and
00:48:08 the other thing i'd say about it is
00:48:10 you've got to be a brand at a certain
00:48:11 point that stands for something or you
00:48:13 stand for nothing
00:48:14 and if you can't listen
00:48:17 to the customers and make a decision
00:48:20 about that
00:48:20 and and have a point of view about
00:48:22 things that feel
00:48:24 really important to people yeah then you
00:48:27 know
00:48:27 i think you're missing an opportunity so
00:48:29 that's we'll see how that all goes but
00:48:31 awesome
00:48:31 so far it's everyone's applauded it i've
00:48:34 not had anyone
00:48:35 been upset about it okay i have brought
00:48:37 our family
00:48:38 for the last 19 years to downtown
00:48:42 nordstrom for santa
00:48:43 yeah are we going to get santa am i
00:48:45 going to get 20 years in a row of my
00:48:47 family with santa this year
00:48:49 i don't think so probably not yeah
00:48:52 it didn't seem like the right thing i
00:48:53 mean you can't you know you think about
00:48:56 sitting on santa's lap it seems a little
00:48:58 i actually heard an official declaration
00:49:00 of that but what does the cdc say about
00:49:05 whatever there might be a virtual santa
00:49:08 opportunity i'm not
00:49:09 sure we can't wrap them in place that's
00:49:11 not a thing
00:49:12 no okay so maybe not lots of
00:49:14 conversation on this
00:49:16 hot topic um if you have any pull in the
00:49:18 fashion community
00:49:19 which you probably do can you please
00:49:22 encourage
00:49:23 clothiers to put real pockets in women's
00:49:26 clothes
00:49:27 wow there's a lot of greater around
00:49:30 women's clothes and the lack of pockets
00:49:32 or the size of pockets and pockets
00:49:33 getting no respect
00:49:34 okay you heard it here first you're
00:49:36 going to be the man that puts pogba
00:49:38 based on my experience of selling
00:49:40 women's shoes and clothes
00:49:42 not not not first of all auto all
00:49:43 customers are the same
00:49:45 but what most customers do is they talk
00:49:47 about the practical things they might
00:49:48 want but the fact is they're going to
00:49:50 put on whatever they're going to put on
00:49:51 and they're going to look at themselves
00:49:53 in the mirror and they go
00:49:54 does this look good do i look at the
00:49:56 pocket
00:49:58 i think it probably could but women are
00:50:01 way smarter than guys when it comes to
00:50:03 understanding
00:50:04 fit and how things look on their body
00:50:06 like i'll use an example several years
00:50:07 ago when
00:50:08 flat front pants and trimmer pants
00:50:11 became an idea rather than the big super
00:50:13 buzzy like
00:50:13 pleated pants because a woman wouldn't
00:50:15 wear a big pleated pant because they
00:50:17 think it makes them look
00:50:19 they were more aware they're yeah so
00:50:21 does this mean the new iphone
00:50:23 is gonna be popular because as as
00:50:25 pockets because i think
00:50:27 pockets could be your whole new women's
00:50:29 department look i i think there's a
00:50:31 practical issue there
00:50:33 that's what the handbag's about maybe i
00:50:34 don't know
00:50:36 i use my wonderful wife
00:50:43 favorite memory from a fashion show have
00:50:44 you ever sat next to somebody really
00:50:46 interesting
00:50:47 oh yeah it's a fashion show moment or a
00:50:49 fun one
00:50:50 and also is zoolander real i just i
00:50:52 gotta say that is it fictional is
00:50:54 kind of fictional but um i've sat next
00:50:56 to all kinds of crazy people at the
00:50:58 fashion shows
00:50:59 you know he says i don't know i don't
00:51:03 paul mccartney or oh that's fine do you
00:51:05 remember what he was wearing
00:51:06 sting or i mean there's i mean does
00:51:08 anyone at a fashion show like look you
00:51:10 up and down and kind of
00:51:11 judge you do you all judge each other
00:51:15 i used to think that was a thing but
00:51:16 what i learned along the way is people
00:51:18 care
00:51:18 way more about what they look like than
00:51:20 what anyone else looks like
00:51:22 super super super narcissistic but
00:51:24 there's i mean you know the kardashians
00:51:26 they're all at these shows and over time
00:51:28 the shows have become less about
00:51:30 retailers doing buying and much more
00:51:32 about a social
00:51:33 okay so one person so they're i mean it
00:51:36 is a full-blown
00:51:37 one person at the next fashion show that
00:51:39 if you sat next to it you would you
00:51:41 would be a little bit like
00:51:42 like a little gaga a little like like
00:51:44 freaking out well the paul mccartney one
00:51:46 kind of paul mccartney got to you
00:51:47 well i mean you know his daughter is a
00:51:49 fashion designer and so you would always
00:51:51 see still yeah at the sell mccartney
00:51:53 shows and he's there
00:51:54 i mean it is i mean you're like you're
00:51:56 walking the show and all of a sudden
00:51:57 you're like
00:51:58 are you like what's going on what's up i
00:52:00 mean it's paul mccartney you'd like to
00:52:01 take a jacket and kind of approve okay
00:52:04 but your question was about how do i i
00:52:05 don't fit in at all i mean you can see
00:52:08 if you go to um these things on the
00:52:11 fashion shows you can see the runway
00:52:12 shows
00:52:13 and you can usually see me i'm in the
00:52:14 front but i'm the big tall guy
00:52:17 like his feet sticking out there that
00:52:18 looks like he absolutely does not belong
00:52:20 like in any way so i stick out like a
00:52:22 sore throat next question uh
00:52:24 what are you reading lately what book
00:52:26 have you read that has influenced yeah
00:52:27 that you do
00:52:28 i want to know this oh my god you've got
00:52:30 kids in school you're running a company
00:52:33 you're independent
00:52:34 what's on your bedside table right now i
00:52:36 got a book that's
00:52:37 about um young women about my daughter's
00:52:41 age
00:52:42 that i was told to read so i could
00:52:43 understand my daughter
00:52:45 my ten-year-old daughter so that's
00:52:47 what's
00:52:48 but i actually i don't read a lot of
00:52:50 business books i don't
00:52:52 i get so many articles and things all
00:52:54 the time that i don't
00:52:55 i really don't read a lot of business
00:52:57 books that's going to break people's
00:52:58 hearts
00:52:59 i was an english major in school too so
00:53:00 i read a lot of books but that's
00:53:02 i don't really read business books i
00:53:04 talk to people okay yeah
00:53:06 do you have an answer i i know i just i
00:53:09 don't read business but every classics i
00:53:10 mean books that are like see
00:53:11 there you go 100 years old i'm reading
00:53:13 i'm sure everyone cares my opinion i do
00:53:15 what are you reading we're reading a
00:53:16 book about what it looks like to strip
00:53:18 technology from your home and how do you
00:53:21 raise knowledge you let me know how that
00:53:22 goes
00:53:23 what are you reading it's called the
00:53:26 tech something tech
00:53:27 wise we got to get that book okay
00:53:31 by the way percent chance you'll ever
00:53:33 open a store in redmond
00:53:35 oh this is a question coming from a
00:53:38 full-line store
00:53:39 i mean a nordstrom full-line store not a
00:53:41 rack or something
00:53:42 no like oh yeah nordstrom the full the
00:53:45 full monty
00:53:46 is it ever a market you've looked at
00:53:47 zero so you're saying
00:53:49 zero come on zero come on zero we're
00:53:52 gonna go less than one
00:53:53 let's go left so we gotta
00:53:59 next question uh what is happening with
00:54:01 the nordstrom locals and are they on
00:54:03 hold
00:54:04 uh actually we just opened could you
00:54:06 define a nordstrom local because i don't
00:54:08 know what that was
00:54:08 nordstrom local is like a 2 000 square
00:54:11 foot
00:54:12 storefront um that's usually
00:54:15 embedded in a neighborhood that's a
00:54:17 pretty dense neighborhood that's a lot
00:54:18 of our customers
00:54:19 but it's not super close to a store the
00:54:22 perfect example where those work
00:54:25 is in new york because you have these
00:54:27 distinct neighborhoods
00:54:28 and people if they live up on the upper
00:54:30 upper east side they would never go to
00:54:31 soho that seems ridiculous
00:54:33 yeah so we can't we're not going to have
00:54:35 a little micro nordstrom but we don't
00:54:36 sell anything in there it's a way of
00:54:38 extending our services
00:54:40 really so we take returns we do
00:54:43 alterations
00:54:44 a stylist could meet you there um you
00:54:47 know some
00:54:48 pay their bill or whatever i mean it's
00:54:49 meant to be an extension of our services
00:54:52 that is embedded and close to where
00:54:55 customers are
00:54:56 and they are busy places so we just
00:54:57 opened to we opened
00:54:59 one newport beach california and
00:55:01 manhattan beach in l.a
00:55:03 is it we i think we'll have to see where
00:55:05 that all goes but for right now we're
00:55:06 you know that
00:55:08 the uh investment is not super high
00:55:11 relatively
00:55:11 and there's a lot of flexibility you
00:55:13 don't lease those things for 30 years
00:55:15 you
00:55:15 have a year to your release and you see
00:55:16 how it goes i love it next question
00:55:19 uh can i get your beautiful gray knit
00:55:21 jacket and a woman's four
00:55:23 with pockets yes
00:55:27 as worn by pete nordstrom do it do we do
00:55:30 we label
00:55:31 these rackets i don't know they go next
00:55:33 question
00:55:34 okay uh i see you've partnered with some
00:55:37 seattle restaurants
00:55:38 and chefs in your manhattan flagship yep
00:55:42 how's that going also right
00:55:45 when is the canalis nordstrom collab
00:55:47 happening
00:55:48 and why hasn't is it weird if we call it
00:55:50 canvas local we could do
00:55:53 i think it'd be cool to do a candlestick
00:55:54 no we we opened up
00:55:56 it's been a little over a year now we
00:55:58 opened the tower there
00:56:00 in new york the women's store i mean
00:56:02 literally within
00:56:03 four or five months we had to kind of
00:56:05 shut it down so it's it's back open now
00:56:08 timing was hard timing was rough but we
00:56:09 did a restaurant we partnered with ethan
00:56:11 stoll which has
00:56:12 done really well and tom douglas helped
00:56:14 us on the concept a couple of
00:56:15 restaurants
00:56:16 and those guys i mean those they're
00:56:18 great guys they're pretty good yeah and
00:56:19 you know
00:56:20 i mean i i like those guys we love them
00:56:25 the best thing we can do in new york is
00:56:27 not try to out new york new york with
00:56:29 another white tablecloth italian
00:56:30 restaurant but to try to bring something
00:56:32 that felt
00:56:33 authentic in seattle i think it's
00:56:36 stunning i think it's like
00:56:37 really beautiful so congratulations
00:56:40 thank you that's
00:56:41 and and and also just like bold move to
00:56:44 go to manhattan that's like
00:56:46 we had no idea i was proud of the
00:56:48 satellite to be like
00:56:49 kapow nordstrom is here how do you like
00:56:51 me now uh purses do not count as pockets
00:56:53 or handbags don't don't nope a lot of
00:56:56 anger a lot of anger
00:56:59 i was gonna take it back a lot of
00:57:01 friends this season of learning
00:57:02 will find a way to take care of you nice
00:57:05 question i'm curious how you manage
00:57:07 bad customer service at the half yearly
00:57:09 sale
00:57:10 i've only tried shopping at once and it
00:57:12 seems like the customers are insane
00:57:15 i would prefer to shop at bad customer
00:57:17 service bad bad customers
00:57:19 customers no knock back great customer
00:57:21 service like there's no
00:57:22 crazy crazy shoppers there's no bad
00:57:25 customers right
00:57:26 there are no bad customers but they can
00:57:28 sure act poorly well there's
00:57:30 there can be some unfortunate
00:57:32 circumstances i think it's the same
00:57:33 thing i mean if people can't be
00:57:36 my dad used to talk about this there's a
00:57:37 test of reasonableness yeah
00:57:39 that requires some judgment and if
00:57:41 people are going to be rude or
00:57:42 unreasonable or
00:57:44 i don't know but for the most part
00:57:46 particularly things get really busy it
00:57:48 gets back to that idea of
00:57:50 there's empathy or grace you talk about
00:57:52 putting yourself in their shoes
00:57:53 they may have a big stressed out
00:57:54 situation i think we've got to figure
00:57:56 out a way to try to
00:57:57 turn that around that's what we tried
00:58:00 someone with
00:58:01 their emotional wits about them can
00:58:02 pretty quickly just
00:58:04 see what's going on behind the scenes
00:58:06 and nine times out of ten
00:58:07 or higher you kind of pick that apart
00:58:09 and be like
00:58:10 ah i hear you you came across rough
00:58:12 aggressive
00:58:13 agitated but really this is what you
00:58:15 need and i feel like that's
00:58:17 in our society people feel the need to
00:58:19 really lean into it without with
00:58:21 hyperbole for someone to hear them
00:58:23 and once you guys are about to talk on
00:58:26 tv
00:58:26 yeah yeah i know exactly but that is
00:58:28 true and i think
00:58:30 if we can tone that down tone down and
00:58:32 just actually have a conversation
00:58:34 we almost always confront us i feel like
00:58:35 saying to people um i woke up this
00:58:37 morning really excited to serve a bunch
00:58:39 of strangers and you
00:58:40 seem really angry at me i'm here to help
